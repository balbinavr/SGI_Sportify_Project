Buffalo Springfield,3eskO5m0H4yiF64vRySBjr,For What It's Worth,1qRA5BS78u3gME0loMl9AA, There s something happening here But what it is ai nt exactly clear There s a man with a gun over there Telling me I got to beware I think it s time we stop children what s that sound Everybody look what s going down There s battle lines being drawn And nobody s right if everybody s wrong Young people speaking their minds Getting so much resistance from behind It s time we stop hey what s that sound Everybody look what s going down What a field day for the heat A thousand people in the street Singing songs and carrying signs Mostly say Hooray for our side It s time we stop hey what s that sound Everybody look what s going down Paranoia strikes deep Into your life it will creep It starts when you re always afraid Step out of line the man come and take you away We better stop hey what s that sound Everybody look what s going down You better stop hey what s that sound Everybody look what s going down You better stop now what s that sound Everybody look what s going down We better stop children what s that sound Everybody look what s going down
Buffalo Springfield,3eskO5m0H4yiF64vRySBjr,Mr. Soul,042v1NacbKJzCyi6nBme7T, Oh hello Mr Soul I dropped by to pick up a reason For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin I ll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her Any girl in the world could have easily known me better She said You re strange but do nt change and I let her In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster Is it strange I should change I do nt know why do nt you ask her Is it strange I should change I do nt know why do nt you ask her Is it strange I should change I do nt know why do nt you ask her Is it strange I should change I do nt know why do nt you ask her Is it strange I should change I do nt know why do nt you ask her
