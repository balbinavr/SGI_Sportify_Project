Jimi Hendrix,776Uo845nYHJpNaStv1Ds4,All Along the Watchtower,2aoo2jlRnM3A0NyLQqMN2f, There must be some kind of way out of here Said the joker to the thief There s too much confusion I ca nt get no relief Businessmen they drink my wine Plowmen dig my earth None will level on the line Nobody up in his word Hey No reason to get excited The thief he kindly spoke There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke but uh But you and I we ve been through that And this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now The hour s getting late Hey Hey All along the watchtower Princes kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants too well uh Outside in the cold distance A wild cat did growl Two riders were approaching And the wind began to howl Hey All along the watchtower Beware beware here Yeah baby Oh baby All along the watchtower

Jimi Hendrix,776Uo845nYHJpNaStv1Ds4,The Wind Cries Mary,5H6Jp0syB5yEPk7SWYdlmk, After all the jacks are in their boxes And the clowns have all gone to bed You can hear happiness staggering on down the street Footprints dressed in red And the wind whispers Mary A broom is drearily sweeping Up the broken pieces of yesterday s life Somewhere a queen is weeping Somewhere a king has no wife And the wind it cries Mary The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow And shine their emptiness down on my bed The tiny island sags downstream Cause the life that lived is dead And the wind screams Mary Will the wind ever remember The names it has blown in the past And with this crutch its old age and its wisdom It whispers No this will be the last And the wind cries Mary

Jimi Hendrix,776Uo845nYHJpNaStv1Ds4,Castles Made of Sand,3qebSLgUwaEqbwCM5sj5Kh, Down the street you can hear her scream You re a disgrace As she slams the door in his drunken face And now he stands outside And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool He cries Oh girl you must be mad What happened to the sweet love you and me had Against the door he leans and starts a scene And his tears fall and burn on the garden green And so castles made of sand Fall in the sea Eventually A little Indian brave who before he was ten Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends And he built a dream that when he grew up He would be a fierce warrior Indian chief Many moons passed fore the dream grew strong Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song And fight his first battle but something went wrong Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand Melts into the sea Eventually There was a young girl whose heart was a frown Because she was crippled for life and she could nt speak a sound And she wished and prayed she could stop living So she decided to die She drove her wheelchair to the edge of the shore And to her legs she smiled You wo nt hurt me no more But then a sight she d never seen made her jump and say Look a golden winged ship is passing my way And it really did nt ever stop It just kept on going And so castles made of sand Slips into the sea Eventually
