Dan Caplen,2U3FuHYvL3vhkbDAXm24Ep,Astray,6EYrKGmr5DS7hLMrbO0vNE, Can you hear the sirens off in the distance Hoping they dont come my way While Im tryna maintain keep up resistance I can feel them hiding off in the shadows Hear em whispering my name But Im tryna maintain on the straight and narrow Shes tryna explain all the things she might do If I only just let her She keep talking about love I only just met her Tryna be a man of my word down to the letter And if I didnt know better Id swear that you were tryna break me Make me learn the error of my ways The whole room is lost in the beat as we sway She leans into me and says dont be a stranger and And I could be so easily persuaded So please dont you lead me astray Cause I been up so high free falling I feel like well be kings by morning And in the quiet I can hear them calling I feel like well be kings by morning In the eerie silence while the citys sleeping I replay it in my brain All the strangers and exchanges of the evening The secrets I been keeping But I been running my mouth running round town running amok running rampant I been forming habits throwing caution to the wind reckless abandon I been talking candid to these strangers man but they cant understand it That Im dropping off the face of the planet shit this aint how I planned it What you grabbing my hand for Tryna drag me out on that dance floor Something tells me that you a handful and I aint the one to make demands on but All of this going round and around in my head whether Im here or Im there Looking around at me at every one else and Im wondering what is it running round theirs The whole room is lost in the beat as we sway She leans into me and says Dont be afraid The look in her eye saying I should obey Surrounded by all of the downfallen prey Cause the whole room is lost in the beat as we sway Its so hard to leave and so easy to stay Then it hits meand I hate to be so cliche Its me whos gon lead me astray Cause I been up so high free falling I feel like well be kings by morning And in the quiet I can hear them calling I feel like well be kings by morning Cause I been up so high free falling I feel like well be kings by morning I guess I didnt heed that warning I feel like well be kings by morning
