Blind Melon,5sD1ZLf2dGQ9gQ3YJl1eAd,Toes Across The Floor,3NfLSMOVWDKfYDE0WAm7uf, Does nt anybody feel That all these killers should be killed All these healers should be healed So all these beggers can be filled Now tell me why am I to lie If I m holding firm and feel the right To lie down beside this dog of mine And let that perverted thought really run through my mind I d scrape my toes across the floor This day s the same as those before And though inside I m feeling giddy Always wrong for never giving myself an uninvaded door So now I ll take a little glue I ll put together a new glittered room for you So I can start sitting so pretty Instead of sitting here not seein clear Just sitting here not fittin here No things ai nt fittin here I ll just lay my head down beside this God of mine And let that perverted thought burn a hole in my mind And if I ca nt lay my head beside this God of mine Maybe the Hunter s dog called God Could be a friend in time
