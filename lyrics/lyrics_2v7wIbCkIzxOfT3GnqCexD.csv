Cody Jinks,2v7wIbCkIzxOfT3GnqCexD,Loud and Heavy,0SF38KDlXNLJAxbYyOMnCy, Loud thunder heavy rain Thin line between joy and pain It s a long strange trip it s all insane You ai nt ever gon na be the same Living life through the night Thin line of a lightning strike Sometimes the only light When the moon is tucked away Pistons pumping minds are racing It s hard to sleep man when I m shaking Bad news surrounds me it s always found me Creeping up when things are good Yeah the dark days find a way Loud thunder heavy rain Thin line between joy and pain It s a long strange trip it s all insane You ai nt ever gon na be the same Living life through the night Thin line of a lightning strike Sometimes the only light When the moon is tucked away The camera captures all the things that Make us turn from what we see It s always moving it do nt stop rolling I have nt slept in three damn days Yeah but who needs that anyway Loud thunder heavy rain Thin line between joy and pain It s a long strange trip it s all insane You ai nt ever gon na be the same Living life through the night Thin line of a lightning strike Sometimes the only light When the moon is tucked away Loud thunder heavy rain Thin line between joy and pain It s a long strange trip it s all insane You ai nt ever gon na be the same Living life through the night Thin line of a lightning strike Sometimes the only light When the moon is tucked away Loud thunder heavy rain Loud thunder heavy rain Thin line between joy and pain A long strange trip it s all insane You ai nt ever gon na be the same Loud thunder heavy rain Loud thunder heavy rain
Cody Jinks,2v7wIbCkIzxOfT3GnqCexD,Must Be The Whiskey,6VChAU4QENeLwf3OaHBJxC, No I m not goin crazy but lately my head and my heart Seem to be at least a million miles apart My heart says to love ya my head says to run It s like my heart is too afraid to tell my head what it s done I know that it can never be the way it was Even though you ll be the death of me I ca nt give you up Too much is not enough it s not the love it s not the lust that grips me It must be the whiskey I ve been drinkin to remember and drinkin to forget I got I love you on my mind I got Jim Beam on my breath And loneliness has got the rest I ve got nothin left within me It must be the whiskey No I m not goin crazy but lately these thoughts in my head Are a whirlwind of a world of a million regrets All the things I should ve done all the things I should ve said All the pain that comes with hatin the mess you ve made of yourself I know I m chasin rainbows thinkin I could make it work But the fact is that my actions speak louder than my words And it only makes it worse thinkin of her thinkin she ll forgive me It must be the whiskey I ve been drinkin to remember and drinkin to forget I got I love you on my mind I got Jim Beam on my breath And loneliness has got the rest I ve got nothin left within me It must be the whiskey I ve been drinkin to remember and drinkin to forget I got I love you on my mind I got Jim Beam on my breath And loneliness has got the rest I ve got nothin left within me Sometimes it hits me whenever I m a little tipsy Oh it hits me whenever I m a little tipsy It must be the whiskey It must be the whiskey It must be the whiskey It s that whiskey It must be the whiskey
