Joe Walsh,5bDxAyJiTYBat1YnFJhvEK,The Confessor,2gBq12zOMMa5ZAl9zFMjfK, If you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well What you see is only on the surface When you try to see the meaning hidden underneath The measure of the depth can be deceiving The bottom has a rocky reputation You can feel it in the distance the deeper down you stare From up above it s hard to see but you know when you re there On the bottom words are shallow On the surface talk is cheap You can only judge the distance by the company you keep In the eyes of the Confessor In the eyes of the Confessor There s no place you can hide You ca nt hide from the eyes of the Confessor Do nt you even try In the eyes of the Confessor You ca nt tell a lie You can not tell a lie to the Confessor Strip you down to size Naked as the day that you were born Naked as the day that you were born Take all the trauma drama comments The guilt and doubt and shame The what ifs and if onlys The shackles and the chains The violence and aggression The pettiness and scorn The jealousy and hatred The tempest and discord And give it up
