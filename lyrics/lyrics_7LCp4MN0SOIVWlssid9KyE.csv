Mountain,7LCp4MN0SOIVWlssid9KyE,For Yasgur's Farm,76WEdM5L1tsllTGk2CW64s, Who am I but you and the sun A slight reflection of everyone Was it me who let you walk away Were you the one or is it we re the same What are we in time going by The simple story of a younger life Half in dreams and somehow through the day We have nt come so far to lose our way Look at me I believe it s true You re a part of me I m a part of you Love is only what we come to live The waking breathing and all we give A crystal passing reflected in our eyes Eclipsing all the jealousy and lies Look at me ca nt you see it s true You re a part of me I m a part of you Quiet as the voices in a dream Without two shadows the things I ve seen Remember the evening I let you walk away Were you the one or is it we re the same Look at me I believe it s true You re a part of me I m a part of you

Mountain,7LCp4MN0SOIVWlssid9KyE,Theme for an Imaginary Western,6zpPyMFnLMO5xcSVmvm0FP, When the wagons leave the city For the forest and further on Painted wagon of the morning Dusty roads where they have gone Sometimes travelin through the darkness At the summer comin home Foreign faces by the wayside Look as if they had nt known Oh the sad was in their eyes And the desert that s dry In a country town Where the map was found Oh the dancing and the singing Oh the music when they play Oh the fire that they saw there On the grave of no return Sometimes they found it sometimes they kept it Often lost it on the way Pawnee shadow to possess him Sometimes ride inside of day Oh the sad was in their eyes And the desert that s dry In the country town Where the map was found Oh the sad was in their eyes And the desert that s dry In a country town Where the map was found
