ayokay,4BzCdhJTyTS3gumq9xmymb,Sleepless Nights,4PUWpNtDejQwwa80LjvxXl, Midnight Driving till my eyes give up Headlights To your apartment This ride I done it bout a thousand times But it does nt feel right Here without you It takes me back to windows down in ocean air Sunset eyes through messy hair I miss chasing down the morning light And all those sleepless nights I know that it s over But it s haunting me Like a ghost of the summer I still see Midnight drives and summer skin The taste of liquor on your lips I miss chasing down the morning light And all those sleepless nights Face up Watching all the streetlights turn To shadows In my apartment Ten months I swear I should be fine by now But it still gives me a head rush When I hear your name It takes me back to Rooftop moonlight silhouettes Purple skies and cigarettes I miss chasing down the morning light And all those sleepless nights I know that it s over But it s haunting me Like a ghost of the summer I still see Midnight trudging summer skin The taste of liquor on your lips I miss chasing down the morning light And all those sleepless nights All those sleepless nights I know that it s over Like a ghost of the summer
