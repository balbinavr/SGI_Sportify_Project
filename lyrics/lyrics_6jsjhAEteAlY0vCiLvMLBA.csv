ROZES,6jsjhAEteAlY0vCiLvMLBA,Matches,7nwGvxqSrgAuty1tlPGCFz, I remember how we used to be so beautiful You broke my heart at 16 The first time I felt my world come crashing Black magic like your heart was made of matches And I never got over it I swear your friends know when to post your photograph It doesnt really hurt but it always takes me back to 16 In your basement and your parents my feelings And I never got over it How did you break my heart without even trying How are you on my mind You re not even talking to me You were made of matches and you burned me to the ground You were made of matches and you burned me down Everybody says that you re still living your life One weekend to the next still tryna get it right The truth is I worry you never found something to escape who you used to be I found my own way of coping with your mess And I found my own reasons why you were nt the best for me Why could nt you be the best for me How did you break my heart without even trying How are you on my mind You re not even talking to me You were made of matches and you burned me to the ground You were made of matches and you burned me down You were made of matches and you burned me down I never got over it I never got over it
