Queens of the Stone Age,4pejUc4iciQfgdX6OKulQn,No One Knows,6NvRxjfYkkT2SpirAlmsjH, We get some rules to follow That and this these and those No one knows We get these pills to swallow How they stick in your throat Tastes like gold Oh what you do to me No one knows And I realize you re mine Indeed a fool am I And I realize you re mine Indeed a fool am I I I journey through the desert Of the mind with no hope I follow I drift along the ocean Dead lifeboats in the sun And come undone Pleasantly caving in I come undone And I realize you re mine Indeed a fool am I And I realize you re mine Indeed a fool am I I Heaven smiles above me What a gift here below But no one knows The gift that you give to me No one knows
