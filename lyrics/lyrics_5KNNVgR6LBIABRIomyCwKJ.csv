Dermot Kennedy,5KNNVgR6LBIABRIomyCwKJ,A closeness,0xVrusjXiWhqSQ5dPoiiWX, Keeping her bright eyes focused on the coastline waiting for you Is nt she all of us pining for that last kiss a permanent truth a means to get through Maybe we ll cry whilst hopeful when we think about the past being cruel Got a thought for those who start to think of love as the pursuit of a fool it s a palace from ruin Deep into the night eyes closing heart swollen with my loving for you A solid embrace kind face and then the hurt starts leaving the room followed by goons Sometimes it s open wide and light the road at night you ve got a heart like the moon Gather courage if you re doing something do it cause she got to go soon If I could now I d never tell you not to love her However leaving her a long way from her home And that ai nt no promise cracking over time A private corner of Roma Do nt shadow the light wait good love grown If I could now If I could now If I could now If I could now If I had you now So keeping bright eyes focused on the coastline waiting for you Do nt give me that byebye baby when the night moves into black from the blue The nights you ve been through Just give me that wide smile made for putting songs into the hearts of the doomed And catch a cold heart staring at the water babe remember you flew If I could now I d never tell you not to love her However leaving her a long way from her home That ai nt no promise cracking over time A private corner of Roma Do nt shadow the light wait good love grown If I could now If I could now If I could now If I could now If I could now I d never tell you not to love her However leaving her a long way from her home And it ai nt no promise cracking over time A private corner of Roma Do nt shadow the light wait good love grown If I could now If I could now If I could now If I could now So say what you want dear But the courage was won With the way that you spoke here When the dreaming was done
