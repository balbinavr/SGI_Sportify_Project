Rascal Flatts,0a1gHP0HAqALbEyxaD5Ngn,What Hurts The Most,4bVuIlGQBMWS7vIhcx8Ae4, I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house That do nt bother me I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out I m not afraid to cry every once in a while Even though going on with you gone still upsets me There are days every now and again I pretend I m okay But that s not what gets me What hurts the most Was being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was tryin to do It s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go But I m doin it It s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I m alone Still harder getting up getting dressed livin with this regret But I know if I could do it over I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart That I left unspoken What hurts the most Was being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was tryin to do What hurts the most Was being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was tryin to do Not seeing that loving you That s what I was tryin to do
