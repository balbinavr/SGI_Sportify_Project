Metallica,2ye2Wgw4gimLv2eAKyk1NB,Hardwired,7myke8Id4WyKFlWcRBJdIF, In the name of desperation In the name of wretched pain In the name of all creation Gone insane We re so fucked Shit out of luck Hardwired to selfdestruct Go On the way to paranoia On the crooked borderline On the way to great destroyer Doomed design We re so fucked Shit out of luck Hardwired to selfdestruct Oh Once upon a planet burning once upon a flame Once upon a fear returning all in vain Do you feel that hope is fading Do you comprehend Do you feel it terminating in the end We re so fucked Shit out of luck Hardwired to selfdestruct Hardwired to selfdestruct Selfdestruct Selfdestruct Selfdestruct
