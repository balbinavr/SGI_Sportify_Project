Wynton Marsalis,375zxMmh2cSgUzFFnva0O7,Layla,0q9K1yk1YF8DvHqk1sRyUw, What will you do when you get lonely No one waiting by your side You ve been running hiding much too long You know it s just your foolish pride Layla you got me on my knees Layla begging darling please Layla darling wo nt you ease my worried mind I tried to give you consolation When your old man let you down Like a fool I fell in love with you You turned my whole world upside down Layla you got me on my knees Layla I m begging darling please Layla darling wo nt you ease my worried mind Make the best of the situation Before I finally go insane Please do nt say we ll never find a way Or tell me all my love s in vain Layla you got me on my knees Layla I am begging darling please Layla darling wo nt you ease my worried mind
