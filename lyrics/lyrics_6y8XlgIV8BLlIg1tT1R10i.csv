Old Dominion,6y8XlgIV8BLlIg1tT1R10i,Written in the Sand,2A69wys3S9uiPSmn6UZWJn, Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend And you wo nt say the words that I want but you flirt when you re drinkin I see those bubbles pop up like you re texting then they disappear Let s cut through the shit then let s get to what we re doing here Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can Are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand Yeah I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf I m asking you baby cause I m tired of asking myself Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can Are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand Are we last call kissing are we dancing in the kitchen baby tell me what it is or what it isnt Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand Are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can Are we names in a tattoo or just a number I should wash right off my hand Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand Are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand
