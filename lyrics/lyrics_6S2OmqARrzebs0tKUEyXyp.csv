Demi Lovato,6S2OmqARrzebs0tKUEyXyp,Solo (feat. Demi Lovato),6kPJZM97LwdG9QIsT7khp6, You speak to me And in your words I hear a melody But in the twilight it s so hard to see What s wrong for me I ca nt resist Until you give the truth a little twist As if you re gon na get away with this You re not sorry I ca nt believe I fell for this I fell through the hole Down at the bottom of your soul Did nt think you could go so low Look at what you ve done Your losing me is what you ve won Got me planning to go solo solo You sing to me Too bad you could nt even stay on key If your life is such a mystery Why do nt you just stick to acting Here we go again You could nt even find my number until when You thought that you could get to my best friend Without a script your game is lacking I ca nt believe I fell for this I fell through the hole Down at the bottom of your soul Did nt think you could go so low Look at what you ve done Your losing me Here s what you ve won Got me planning to go solo solo I d rather go to a party alone Than have to walk around with you on my arm Now that I m proud to admit that we re done Good luck trying to find me Cause I did nt think you could go so low Look at what you ve done Your losing me is what you ve won Got me planning to go solo Now we re done Cause you ve got me planning to go solo solo Solo solo
