The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season),5qBqBdfTEIWJwAS0Jm2F5R, To everything turn turn turn There is a season turn turn turn And a time to every purpose under heaven A time to be born a time to die A time to plant a time to reap A time to kill a time to heal A time to laugh a time to weep To everything turn turn turn There is a season turn turn turn And a time to every purpose under heaven A time to build up a time to break down A time to dance a time to mourn A time to cast away stones A time to gather stones together To everything turn turn turn There is a season turn turn turn And a time to every purpose under heaven A time of love a time of hate A time of war a time of peace A time you may embrace A time to refrain from embracin To everything turn turn turn There is a season turn turn turn And a time to every purpose under heaven A time to gain a time to lose A time to rend a time to sew A time for love a time for hate A time for peace I swear it s not too late

The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,Eight Miles High,2BGNomqCxEDcXyxf8bg27k, Eight miles high And when you touch down You ll find that it s stranger than known Signs in the street That say where you re going Are somewhere just being their own Nowhere is There warmth to be found Among those afraid of losing their ground Raingray town Known for its sound In places small faces unbound Round the squares Huddled in storms Some laughing some just shapeless forms Sidewalk scenes And black limousines Some living some standing alone
The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,My Back Pages,1yexhSDARSLVvRCBU3wDAm, Crimson flames tied through my years Flowing high and mighty trapped Countless fire and flaming roads Using ideas as my maps We ll meet on edges soon said I Proud neath heated brow Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth Rip down all hate I screamed Lies that life is black and white Spoke from my skull I dreamed Romantic flanks of musketeers Foundationed deep somehow Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now In a soldier s stance I aimed my hand At the mongrel dogs who teach Fearing not I d become my enemy In the instant that I preach Sisters fled by confusion boats Mutiny from stern to bow Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now My guard stood hard when abstract threats Too noble to neglect Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect Good and bad I define these terms Quite clear no doubt somehow Ah but I was so much older then I m younger than that now
The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,Wasn't Born to Follow,3Lk77QOBVywNAVSqOPcuw2, Oh I d rather go and journey Where the diamond crescent s glowing And run across the valley Beneath the sacred mountain And wander through the forest Where the trees have leaves of prisms And break the light in colors That noone knows the names of And when it s time I ll go and wait Beside a legendary fountain Till I see your form reflected In its clear and jeweled waters And if you think I m ready You may lead me to the chasm Where the rivers of our vision Flow into one another I will watch her dive beneath The white cascading waters She may beg she may plead She may argue with her logic And mention all the things I ll lose That really have no value In the end she will surely know I was nt born to follow
The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,6kPxXhjSvy8RsmZBAJUiFs, Clouds so swift Rain wo nt lift Gate wo nt close Railings froze Get your mind off wintertime You ai nt goin nowhere Whooee ride me high Tomorrow s the day My bride s gon na come Oh oh are we gon na fly Down in the easy chair I do nt care How many letters they send Morning came and morning went Pack up your money Pick up your tent You ai nt goin nowhere Whooee ride me high Tomorrow s the day My bride s gon na come Oh oh are we gon na fly Down in the easy chair Buy me a flute And a gun that shoots Tailgates and substitutes Strap yourself To a tree with roots You ai nt goin nowhere Whooee ride me high Tomorrow s the day My bride s gon na come Oh oh are we gon na fly Down in the easy chair Now Genghis Kahn He could not keep All his kings Supplied with sleep We ll climb that hill no matter how steep When we get up to it Whooee ride me high Tomorrow s the day My bride s gon na come Oh oh are we gon na fly Down in the easy chair
The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,Goin' Back,6mM3QPK502fHwOYaj6ELmm, I think I m goin back To the things I learned so well in my youth I think I m returning to Those days when I was young enough to know the truth Now there are no games To only pass the time No more electric trains No more trees to climb But thinking young and growing older is no sin And I can play the game of life to win I can recall a time When I was nt ashamed to reach out to a friend Now I think I ve got A lot more than just my toys to lend Now there s more to do Than watch my sailboat glide But every day can be A magic carpet ride A little bit of courage is all we lack So catch me if you can I m goin back La la la la la etc Now there s more to do Than watch my sailboat glide But every day can be A magic carpet ride A little bit of courage is all we lack So catch me if you can I m goin back La la la la etc
The Byrds,1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc,Mr. Spaceman,6TZYGQ2djryNbg98vV5Prg, Woke up this morning with light in my eyes And then realized it was still dark outside It was a light coming down from the sky I do nt know who or why Must be those strangers that come every night Those saucer shaped lights put people uptight Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark I hope they get home all right Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along I wo nt do anything wrong Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along for a ride Woke up this morning I was feeling quite weird Had flies in my beard my toothpaste was smeared Over my window they d written my name Said So long we ll see you again Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along I wo nt do anything wrong Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along for a ride Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along I wo nt do anything wrong Hey Mr Spaceman Wo nt you please take me along for a ride
