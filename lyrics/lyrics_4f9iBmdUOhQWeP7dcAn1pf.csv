Rag'n'Bone Man,4f9iBmdUOhQWeP7dcAn1pf,Skin,6y2Kaz9QI01XBKJ8mTb7Pf, When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I ll be thinking about you About you Seconds from my heart A bullet from the dark Helpless I surrender Shackled by your love Holding me like this With poison on your lips Only when it s over The silence hits so hard Cause it was almost love it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I ll be thinking about you About you When I run out of air to breathe It s your ghost I see I ll be thinking about you about you It was almost love it was almost We bleed ourselves in vain How tragic is this game Turn around I m holding on to someone But the love is gone Carrying the load with wings that feel like stone Knowing that we nearly fell so far now It s hard to tell Yeah we came so close it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I ll be thinking about you About you When I run out of air to breathe It s your ghost I see I ll be thinking about you about you While I reached out for your hand When the walls were caving in When I see you on the other side We can try all over again When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I ll be thinking about you About you When I run out of air to breathe It s your ghost I see I ll be thinking about you about you Cause it was almost love it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love
