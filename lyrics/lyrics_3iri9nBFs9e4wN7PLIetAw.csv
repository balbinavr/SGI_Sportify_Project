gnash,3iri9nBFs9e4wN7PLIetAw,ilusm,1RtO2aDYHvfzjqcItbRAWU, I always see the light way before the dark And you always see the end way before the start I ve been trying and finding that things going right Are nt as simple as everyone told me they would be I know that you miss me I m sorry I m busy And do nt make the time For the things you ask from me Out of breath Out of time Is it your turn Is it mine I ca nt sleep tonight I ca nt sleep tonight no Is it fine if we find That in time this is nt right I ca nt speak tonight I ca nt speak tonight no Just make me feel special And make me feel loved Make me feel something Lately life s made me numb I just want to hold you For just long enough So you do nt get tired of me telling you I love you so much If I take care of you Who s gon na take care of me I could just say take care and leave But I love how you stare at me I stay cause I m scared to leave I m not prepared to be Lonely without you see That just wo nt feel right I need you in my life Out of breath Out of time Is it your turn Is it mine I ca nt sleep tonight I ca nt sleep tonight no Is it fine if we find That in time this is nt right I ca nt speak tonight I ca nt speak tonight no Just make me feel special And make me feel loved Make me feel something Lately life s made me numb I just want to hold you For just long enough So you do nt get tired of me telling you I love you so much So do nt make me no Do nt make me go Do nt make me
