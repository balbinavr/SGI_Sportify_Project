Alan Jackson,4mxWe1mtYIYfP040G38yvS,Remember When,1nCSr7oGeUv7sUEoYuAJFF, Remember when I was young and so were you And time stood still and love was all we knew You were the first so was I We made love and then you cried remember when Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk Gave our hearts made the start and it was hard We lived and learned life threw curves There was joy there was hurt remember when Remember when old ones died and new were born And life was changed disassembled rearranged We came together fell apart And broke each others hearts remember when Remember when the sound of little feet Was the music we danced to week to week Brought back the love we found trust Vowed we d never give it up remember when Remember when thirty seemed so old Now lookin back it s just a steppin stone To where we are where we ve been Said we d do it all again remember when Remember when we said when we turn gray When the children grow up and move away We wo nt be sad we ll be glad For all the life we ve had And we ll remember when Remember when Remember when

Alan Jackson,4mxWe1mtYIYfP040G38yvS,Drive (For Daddy Gene),1FV374EPG5CrjdIbIMLkcv, It was painted red the stripe was white It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her We put on a shine put on a motor Built out of love and made for the water Ran her for years till the transom got rotten A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten It was just an old plywood boat With a 75 Johnson with electric choke A young boy two hands on the wheel I ca nt replace the way it made me feel And I would turn her sharp And I would make it whine He d say You ca nt beat the way a old wood boat rides Just a little lake cross the Alabama line But I was king of the ocean When Daddy let me drive Just an old half ton short bed ford My Uncle bought new in 64 Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking A couple of burnt valves and he had it going He d let me drive her when we haul off a load Down a dirt strip where we d dump trash off of Thickpen Road I d sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels Smiling like a hero who just received his medal It was just an old hand me down ford With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door A young boy two hands on the wheel I ca nt replace the way it made me feel and I would press that clutch And I would keep it right He would say a little slower son Your doing just fine Just a dirt road with trash on each side But I was Mario Andretti When Daddy let me drive I m grown up now 3 daughters of my own I let them drive my old jeep Across the pasture at our home Maybe one day they ll reach back in their file And pull out that old memory And think of me and smile And say It was just an old worn out jeep Rusty old floor boards Hot on my feet A young girl two hands on the wheel I ca nt replace the way it made me feel And he d say Turn it left and steer it right Straighten up girl now you re doing just fine Just a little valley by the river where we d ride But I was high on a mountain When Daddy let me drive Daddy let me drive Oh he let me drive It s just an old plywood boat With a 75 Johnson And electric choke
