EDEN,1t20wYnTiAT0Bs7H1hv9Wt,XO,0ZAiqymvbQUZAh9y6ZT3Rm, Yeah she s in love with the concept As if we re all just how she imagined Cause we re in love but just do nt know it yet Well tell me how I m supposed to see the magic Cause I do nt believe in it no more But I wo nt tell her Cause I always imagined It s easier if she thinks she won So Imma let her And she said I do nt think I love you no more You never seem to call me lately Girl I do nt think you know me at all Cause I never thought I d have to say this No I do nt love you and I never did Look at us burning down in flames for kicks But just know I m not singing for your XO I m just singing cause it s over Uh Yeah Came and went like the summertime Is that a sunset or sunrise Looking back like where d the time go So much for trying to keep this moving slow Cause I do nt believe in her no more But I remember How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted I still remember what she said I do nt think I love you no more You never seem to call me lately But I do nt think she knew me at all Cause I never thought I d have to say this But I m no liar and I never hid anything You should ve seen it coming to this Just know I m not singing for an EX though I m just singing cause it s over Yeah Yeah
