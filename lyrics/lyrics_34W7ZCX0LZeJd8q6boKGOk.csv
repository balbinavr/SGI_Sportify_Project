Ben Webster,34W7ZCX0LZeJd8q6boKGOk,When Your Lover Has Gone,7m4OEcDjdVPVKRhXmnQko5, What good is the scheming the planning and dreaming That comes with each new love affair The dreams that we cherish so often might perish And leaves you with castles in air When you re alone who cares for starlit skies When you re alone the magic moonlight dies At break of dawn there is no sunrise When your lover has gone What lonely hours the evening shadows bring What lonely hours with memories lingering Like faded flowers life ca nt mean anything When your lover has gone
