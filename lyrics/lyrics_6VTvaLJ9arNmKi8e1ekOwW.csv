cleopatrick,6VTvaLJ9arNmKi8e1ekOwW,Belly Button Blues,6quTpVBmZHXxSHaDz72G1f, Stand or sit in front of your mirror Take a deep breath Hold it And Exhale She s been lonely for weeks starting to think he does nt care They say if you had better posture then maybe he d answer your prayers And now the times when I see the weight lift from the sides of her frown She stands up too straight Lord and gravity just brings them back down A rumor a tumor is buried in the years The first of the first lord its the worst of your fears Adam sweet adam starts to feel a little weird When eve comes home with her belly button pierced Well I m not dumb but there s something going on here Well I m not dumb but there s something going on here Call it lust in the dust but it s far from a pharaohs affair The most beautiful girl in all the world and you long for your hand in her hair You sing cleo sweet cleo can I stay with you tonight But when you turn down the lights her anatomy just do nt seem quite right Oh it s a rumor a tumor buried in the years The first of the first lord it s the worst of your fears Adam sweet adam starts to feel a little queer When eve comes home with her belly button pierced

cleopatrick,6VTvaLJ9arNmKi8e1ekOwW,Friends,1jeGYJR4Q5RjsIaWhU84Lh, Lukey honey have you lost yourself I said I think I ve lost my will and all I know I m young but I m scared of hell does god know I ve been running through these halls Crucify a child s mind Tell him true friends are hard to find But in the wrong place at the right time Lord knows I found mine Children children take a look at yourself A gold star if you fit inside the norms And all the others pray to save yourselves A bunch of sinners from the moment you were born Crucify a child s mind Tell him true friends are hard to find But in the wrong place at the right time Lord knows I found mine But do nt ask why lord were born to die it s the human curse It s a genocide But they could have been white so it could have been worse Crucify a child s mind Tell him true friends are hard to find But in the wrong place at the right time Lord knows i found mine
