Tracy Lawrence,2BQVRw9md4UKcGUrDXABCD,Paint Me a Birmingham,2kZZq09uK0oR9wwYJvgacb, He was sittin there his brush in hand Paintin waves as they danced upon the sand With every stroke he brought to life The deep blue of the ocean against the mornin sky I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes He said for twenty dollars I ll paint you anything Could you paint me a Birmingham Make it look just the way I planned A little house on the edge of town Porch goin all the way around Put her there in the front yard swing Cotton dress make it early spring For awhile she ll be mine again If you can paint me a Birmingham He looked at me with knowing eyes Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side Picked up a brush and said to me Son just where in this picture would you like to be I said if there s any way you can Could you paint me back into her arms again Paint me a Birmingham Make it look just the way I planned A little house on the edge of town Porch goin all the way around Put her there in the front yard swing Cotton dress make it early spring For awhile she ll be mine again If you can paint me a Birmingham Paint me a Birmingham Make it look just the way I planned A little house on the edge of town Porch goin all the way around Put her there in the front yard swing Cotton dress make it early spring For awhile she ll be mine again If you can paint me a Birmingham Oh paint me a Birmingham
