The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,I And Love And You,7CEV9VwA8XO9wwxTXgYKvY, Load the car and write the note Grab your bag and grab your coat Tell the ones that need to know We are headed north One foot in and one foot back But it do nt pay to live like that So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks For never to return Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I m in My hands they shake my head it spins Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in When at first I learned to speak I used all my words to fight With him and her and you and me Oh but it s just a waste of time Yeah it s such a waste of time That woman she s got eyes that shine Like a pair of stolen polished dimes She asked to dance I said it s fine I ll see you in the morning time Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I m in My hands they shake my head it spins Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Three words that became hard to say I and love and you What you were then I am today Look at the things I do Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I m in My hands they shake my head it spins Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I m in My hands they shake my head it spins spins Ah Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in Dumbed down and numbed by time and age Your dreams to catch the world the cage The highway sets the traveler s stage All exits look the same Three words that became hard to say I and love and you I and love and you I and love and you

The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,I Wish I Was,1nMlHxWuPc5P9Y5nGvenlj, I wish I was a flame dancing in a candle Lighting up your living room high on the mantle I could bring some romance without any scandal And then when you were done you d just put me out I wish I was a tune you sang in your kitchen Putting your groceries away and washing your dishes I could roll around your tongue and ease the tension And then when you were done you d just quiet down But if I get too close Will the magic fade Would I turn you off or away If I pull you in Now would I push you out Of something here you care about Well I m at a loss for what to do But I m drawn to you I wish I was a sweater wrapped around your hips And when it got too cold into me you d slip And when the sun came back you would hang me up And I would watch you while you undress But if I get too close Will the magic fade Would I turn you off or away If I pull you in Now would I push you out Of something here you care about Well I m at a loss for what to do But I m drawn to you I m not a song I am not a sweater I m not a fire I am something better I m a man in love writing you a letter Will you take it Will you keep it Will you read it Believe it I love you I m sorry
The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,No Hard Feelings,711WfDztCZpnmJg7Uvwod3, When my body wo nt hold me anymore And it finally lets me free Will I be ready When my feet wo nt walk another mile And my lips give their last kiss goodbye Will my hands be steady When I lay down my fears My hopes and my doubts The rings on my fingers And the keys to my house With no hard feelings When the sun hangs low in the west And the light in my chest Wo nt be kept held at bay any longer When the jealousy fades away And it s ash and dust for cash and lust And it s just hallelujah And love in thoughts and love in the words Love in the songs they sing in the church And no hard feelings Lord they knows they have nt done Much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold When my body wo nt hold me anymore And it finally lets me free Where will I go Will the trade winds take me south Through Georgia grain or tropical rain Or snow from the heavens Will I join with the ocean blue Or run into the savior true And shake hands laughing And walk through the night Straight to the light Holding the love I ve known in my life And no hard feelings Lord they knows they have nt done Much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold Under the curving sky I m finally learning why It matters for me and you To say it and mean it too For life and its loveliness And all of its ugliness Good as it s been to me I have no enemies I have no enemies I have no enemies I have no enemies
The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,Head Full Of Doubt/Road Full Of Promise,7Kho44itYaCQZvZQVV2SLW, There s a darkness upon me that s flooded in light In the fine print they tell me what s wrong and what s right And it comes in black and it comes in white And I m frightened by those who do nt see it When nothing is owed deserved or expected And your life does nt change by the man that s elected If you re loved by someone you re never rejected Decide what to be and go be it There was a dream And one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I scream til I die or the last of those bad thoughts are finally out There s a darkness upon you that s flooded in light In the fine print they tell you what s wrong and what s right And it flies by day and it flies by night And I m frightened by those who do nt see it There was a dream And one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I scream til I die or the last of those bad thoughts are finally out There was a dream And one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I scream til I die or the last of those bad thoughts are finally out There s a darkness upon me that s flooded in light In the fine print they tell me what s wrong and what s right There s a darkness upon me that s flooded in light And I m frightened by those who do nt see it

The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,Famous Flower of Manhattan,6ey6o0CyYoRbU71ChOF6zi, I found a flower in a field A field of cars and people Rows of concrete paint and steel Manhattan is where it grew And I thought to cut it from its stem And take it from the cracks Between bricks that it lay in And save it from city strife Away from the city life Then someone they whispered in my ear A county girl ca nt be made out of anybody here Do nt touch it it loves you not Do nt touch it it loves you not Cause blue birds Do nt fly without their wings And when we put them in a cage The world ca nt hear them sing So selfish when greed sets in Possession the king of sin And people do nt ever let you down Forever find a way to kill whatever love they ve found A heart beat and I want it too Manhattan is where she grew So I left and I let the flower be And yesterday saw the flower on cable TV Much prettier than here with me For all of the world to see Much prettier than here with me
The Avett Brothers,196lKsA13K3keVXMDFK66q,Murder in the City,3h5AZDf5z7D18plaLtHTfi, If I get murdered in the city Do nt go revengin in my name One person dead from such as plenty No need to go get locked away When I leave your arms The things that I think of No need to get over alarmed I m comin home I wonder which brother is better Which one our parents love the most I sure did get in lots of trouble They seemed to let the other go A tear fell from my father s eyes I wondered what my dad would say He said I love you And I m proud of you both in so many different ways If I get murdered in the city Go read the letter in my desk Do nt bother with all my belongings But pay attention to the list Make sure my sister knows I loved her Make sure my mother knows the same Always remember there was nothing worth sharing Like the love that let us share our name Always remember there was nothing worth sharing Like the love that let us share our name
