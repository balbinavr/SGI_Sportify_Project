Arcade Fire,3kjuyTCjPG1WMFCiyc5IuB,Everything Now,7KsZHCfOitA5V9oQYVdltG, Every inch of sky s got a star Every inch of skin s got a scar I guess we ve got everything now Every inch of space in your head Is filled up with the things that you read I guess you ve got everything now And every film that you ve ever seen Fills the spaces up in your dreams That reminds me Everything now Everything now Every inch of road s got a sign And every boy uses the same line I pledge allegiance to everything now Every song that I ve ever heard Is playing at the same time it s absurd It reminds me we ve got everything now We turn the speakers up till they break Cause every time you smile it s a fake Stop pretending you ve got Everything now I need it Everything now I want it Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now Everything now Everything now Every ancient road s got a town Daddy how come you re never around I miss you like everything now Mama leave the food on the stove Leave your car in the middle of the road This happy family with everything now We turn the speakers up till they break Cause every time you smile it s a fake Stop pretending you ve got Everything now I need it Everything now I want it Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now Everything now Til every room in my house is filled with shit I could nt live without Everything now I need it Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now Everything now Everything now La la la la la la la La la la la la la la Stop pretending you ve got Everything now I need it Everything now I want it Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now I ca nt live Everything now And every room in my house is filled with shit I could nt live without Everything now I need it Everything now I ca nt live without Everything now I ca nt live Every inch of space in my heart is filled with something wrong then it s dark Ashes of everything now And then you re black again Ca nt make it back again From everything now
Arcade Fire,3kjuyTCjPG1WMFCiyc5IuB,The Suburbs,2UWdUez9MB9yzL7Y81Mcip, In the suburbs I I learned to drive And you told me we d never survive Grab your mother s keys we re leaving You always seemed so sure that one day we d be fighting in a suburban war Your part of town against mine I saw you standing on the opposite shore But by the time the first bombs fell we were already bored We were already already bored Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling again The kids want to be so hard but in my dreams We re still screaming and running through the yard When all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall Meant nothing at all meant nothing at all it meant nothing Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling and into the night So can you understand why I want a daughter while I m still young I want to hold her hand and show her some beauty before all this damage is done But if it s too much to ask if it s too much to ask then send me a son Under the overpass in the parking lot we re still waiting it s already past So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass Cause it s already past it s already already past Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling Sometimes I ca nt believe it I m moving past the feeling again I m moving past the feeling I m moving past the feeling In my dreams we re still screaming We re still screaming We re still screaming
Arcade Fire,3kjuyTCjPG1WMFCiyc5IuB,Wake Up,6Hmj7SrLRbreLVfVS7mV1S, Something filled up my heart with nothing Someone told me not to cry But now that I m older my heart s colder And I can see that it s a lie Children wake up hold your mistake up Before they turn the summer into dust If the children do nt grow up Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up We re just a million little gods causing rain storms Turning every good thing to rust I guess we ll just have to adjust With my lightning bolts aglowing I can see where I am going to be When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand With my lightning bolts aglowing I can see where I am going With my lightning bolts aglowing I can see where I am going You better look out below
