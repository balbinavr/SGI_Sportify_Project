Lady Antebellum,32WkQRZEVKSzVAAYqukAEA,Heart Break,3YZ5TNGA10oTLaADq4zuNV, I paint my lips red I turn my own head Do nt need nobody s help zipping up my own dress Pay my own tab with my own cash unattached Sometimes the world alone sounds like a sad song Why s it got ta be cause what I really need is a reset And a deep breath yeah I think it s time to take a heart break out late Solo on a Saturday night Going out without a plus one I m done Falling over pickup lines I m single for the summer I wo nt rebound One lover to another or be tied down I m sleeping like a queen in a California king I made I made I made I think it s time to take a heart break I think it s time to take a heart break It s just a little phase give me a little space You might see through it but I m putting on a poker face Give a love a rest between my ex and my next I think it s time to take a heart break out late Solo on a Saturday night Going out without a plus one I m done Falling over pickup lines I m single for the summer I wo nt rebound One lover to another or be tied down Till I m sleeping like a queen in a California king I made I made I made I think it s time to take a heart break I think it s time to take a heart break Love I m over you love I m over you It s long overdue I think it s time to take a heart break I m single for the summer I wo nt rebound I think it s time to take a heart break I think it s time to take a heart break out late Solo on a Saturday night Going out without a plus one I m done Falling over pickup lines I m single for the summer I wo nt rebound One lover to another or be tied down Till I m sleeping like a queen in a California king I made I made I made I think it s time to take a heart break I think it s time to take a heart break
