Wale,67nwj3Y5sZQLl72VNUHEYE,The Need To Know (feat. SZA),6KacmqPPQ3LNoiGFuqGChs, I guess maybe some little problems could arise There are always a few If anything happened and we could nt be friends the way we are now that would really be bad Devastating Because this is very good And that would be good That would be good too the idea is to combine this with that Tryna keep it low Keep em on that need to know Tell everybody that we re just friends But to be honest that plutonic shit s for TV shows Same place we re with different folks Case closed if they crack the code Is it me or is you cold Cause the feelings you ai nt showin pokin out your clothes Go put a sweater on or get a room Forbidden fruit swim in your juice Lot of ways I can get to you But my train of thought is tryna get you out your chchchoo Still we keep it low Keep em on that need to know Cause somebody tell somebody And somebody then sorry but somebody gon need to go I m not tryna pressure you Just ca nt stop thinkin bout you You ai nt even really got ta be my boyfriend I just wan na know your name And maybe some time We can hook up We can hang out we can just chill Tryna keep it low Keep em on that need to know Tell everybody that we re just cool As far as me and you we got a simple code Spendin nights well that s optional No telephones in the afternoon I know that overthinkin only leads to subtweetin Every time your ass in the mood Sharin thoughts when we share a room Though we barely talk when we share a room In the dark still see your curves Body like what swear to God you re a miracle I m not tryna pressure you Just ca nt stop thinkin bout you You ai nt even really got ta be my boyfriend I just wan na know your name And maybe some time We can hook up We can hang out we can just chill I mean let s say what if we did What if Is that like the end of the world or something Certainly not Why should nt we be able to do that once in a while if we want to I know I mean really what is the big deal We go in there we re in there for a while and then we come back out here It s not complicated It s almost stupid if we did nt It s moronic Absurd I m not tryna pressure you Just ca nt stop thinkin bout you You ai nt even really got ta be my boyfriend I just wan na know your name And maybe some time We can hook up We can hang out we can just chill
Wale,67nwj3Y5sZQLl72VNUHEYE,Change,1UBp6NPWRYWEqvRtFwIvZO, I saw a dried up river and a rich man Turning on a garden hose I see a young man picking up a gun I guess that s where the money goes yeah Am I just as good as a bad man Sleeping while the rest are dying Or am I just as bad as a good man Saying there s no use of trying Ooh tell me do you still believe Ooh everything that you read Till we learn to get together And see who we really are Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change If nobody s gon na wake up And start asking who s in charge Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt shit changing but diapers on babies Get higher than the background singers singing singing Okay singing Some people do it all for money And some do it all for their love yeah Some do it all for the glory Cause nothing else they re thinking of I saw a man in a four door truck Complaining that the price is high Like a well feed man with a spoon in his hand Saying who ate all the apple pie yeah Ooh tell me do you still believe Ooh everything that you read Till we learn to get together And see who we really are Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change If nobody s gon na wake up And start asking who s in charge Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change If I ai nt ready to listen I m never gon na listen Most follow intuition while they wishing it would work And my vision is nt perfect so I will never look for it Do nt wish for some change like a church worker Hallelujah preacher I am not influenced If I do nt donate to your movement am I not improving And while the poor kill the poor for a portion A piece of American society pie I get high the munchies I got so bear witness I got this girl looking at you cause my reps kissing And I ai nt ready to wait when there s dollars on the brain Why would you expect change Till we learn to get together And see who we really are Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change If nobody s gon na wake up And start asking who s in charge Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change Ai nt nothing gon na change no no Ai nt shit changing but diapers on babies Get higher than the background singers singing singing
