Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2",4gMgiXfqyzZLMhsksGmbQV, We do nt need no education We do nt need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher leave them kids alone Hey teacher leave them kids alone All in all it s just another brick in the wall All in all you re just another brick in the wall We do nt need no education We do nt need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teachers leave them kids alone Hey teacher leave us kids alone All in all you re just another brick in the wall All in all you re just another brick in the wall Wrong Do it again Wrong Do it again If you do nt eat yer meat you ca nt have any pudding How can you have any pudding if you do nt eat yer meat You Yes you behind the bike sheds stand still laddy
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Wish You Were Here,6mFkJmJqdDVQ1REhVfGgd1, So so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change Did you exchange A walkon part in the war for a lead role in a cage How I wish how I wish you were here We re just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year Running over the same old ground what have we found The same old fears Wish you were here
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Comfortably Numb,5HNCy40Ni5BZJFw1TKzRsC, Hello Is there anybody in there Just nod if you can hear me Is there anyone home Come on now I hear you re feeling down I can ease your pain And get you on your feet again Relax I ll need some information first Just the basic facts Can you show me where it hurts There is no pain you are receding A distant ship smoke on the horizon You are only coming through in waves Your lips move but I ca nt hear what you re saying When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons Now I ve got that feeling once again I ca nt explain you would not understand This is not how I am I have become comfortably numb I have become comfortably numb OK Just a little pinprick There ll be no more aaaaaaaah But you may feel a little sick Can you stand up I do believe it s working good That ll keep you going through the show Come on it s time to go There is no pain you are receding A distant ship smoke on the horizon You are only coming through in waves Your lips move but I ca nt hear what you re saying When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye I turned to look but it was gone I can not put my finger on it now The child is grown The dream is gone I have become comfortably numb
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Money,0vFOzaXqZHahrZp6enQwQb, Money get away Get a good job with more pay and you re okay Money it s a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car caviar four star daydream Think I ll buy me a football team Money get back I m all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack Money it s a hit Do nt give me that do goody good bullshit I m in the hifidelity first class travelling set And I think I need a Lear jet Money it s a crime Share it fairly but do nt take a slice of my pie Money so they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a rise it s no surprise that theyre Giving none away Away away away away away away away Yeah I was in the right Yes absolutely in the right I certainly was in the right Yeah I was definitely in the right That geezer was cruising for a bruising Why does anyone do anything Yeah Why does anyone do anything I do nt know I was really drunk at the time I was just telling him it was in he could get it in number two He was asking why it was nt coming up on fader eleven After I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it was nt coming up on fader eleven It came to a heavy blow which sorted the matter out
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Time,3TO7bbrUKrOSPGRTB5MeCz, Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it s sinking Racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way but you re older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone the song is over thought I d something more to say Breathe Reprise Home home again I like to be here when I can When I come home cold and tired 1 It s good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spell
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Breathe (In the Air),2ctvdKmETyOzPb2GiJJT53, Breathe breathe in the air Do nt be afraid to care Leave but do nt leave me Look around choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly And smiles you ll give and tears you ll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run rabbit run Dig that hole forget the sun And when at last the work is done Do nt sit down it s time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Hey You,7F02x6EKYIQV3VcTaTm7oN, Hey you out there in the cold Getting lonely getting old Can you feel me Hey you standing in the aisles With itchy feet and fading smiles Can you feel me Hey you do nt help them to bury the light Do nt give in without a fight Hey you out there on your own Sitting naked by the phone Would you touch me Hey you with your ear against the wall Waiting for someone to call out Would you touch me Hey you would you help me to carry the stone Open your heart I m coming home But it was only fantasy The wall was too high As you can see No matter how he tried He could not break free And the worms ate into his brain Hey you out there on the road Always doing what you re told Can you help me Hey you out there beyond the wall Breaking bottles in the hall Can you help me Hey you do nt tell me there s no hope at all Together we stand divided we fall Click of TV being turned on Well only got an hour of daylight left Better get started Is nt it unsafe to travel at night It ll be a lot less safe to stay here Your father s gon na pick up our trail before long Can Loca ride Yeah I can ride Magaret time to go Maigret thank you for everything Goodbye Chenga Goodbye miss I ll be back
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,The Great Gig in the Sky,2TjdnqlpwOjhijHCwHCP2d, And I am not frightened of dying Any time will do I do nt mind Why should I be frightened of dying There s no reason for it you ve got ta go sometime I never said I was frightened of dying
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Us and Them,1TKTiKp3zbNgrBH2IwSwIx, Us and them And after all we re only ordinary men Me and you God only knows it s not what we would choose to do Forward he cried from the rear And the front rank died And the General sat and the lines on the map Moved from side to side Black and blue And who knows which is which and who is who Up and down And in the end it s only round and round and round Have nt you heard it s a battle of words The poster bearer cried Listen son said the man with the gun There s room for you inside I mean they re gon na kill ya So like if you give em a quick sh short sharp shock they do nt do it again Dig it I mean he get off light cos I could ve given him a thrashing I only hit him once It s only a difference of right and wrong innit I mean good manners do nt cost nothing do they eh Down and out It ca nt be helped but there s a lot of it about With without And who ll deny it s what the fighting s all about 2 Out of the way it s a busy day I ve got things on my mind For want of the price of tea and a slice The old man died
Pink Floyd,0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9,Brain Damage,05uGBKRCuePsf43Hfm0JwX, The lunatic is on the grass The lunatic is on the grass Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs Got to keep the loonies on the path The lunatic is in the hall The lunatics are in my hall The paper holds their folded faces to the floor And every day the paper boy brings more And if the dam breaks open many years too soon And if there is no room upon the hill And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too I ll see you on the dark side of the moon The lunatic is in my head The lunatic is in my head You raise the blade you make the change You rearrange me till I m sane You lock the door and throw away the key There s someone in my head but it s not me And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear You shout and no one seems to hear And if the band you re in starts playing different tunes I ll see you on the dark side of the moon I ca nt think of anything to say except Hahahaha Hahahaha I think it s marvelous Hahaha
