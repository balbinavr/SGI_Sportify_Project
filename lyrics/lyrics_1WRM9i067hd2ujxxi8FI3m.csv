Steppenwolf,1WRM9i067hd2ujxxi8FI3m,Magic Carpet Ride,4c4jJJoaiY21t2TyRZgdWS, I like to dream Yes yes right between my sound machine On a cloud of sound I drift in the night Any place it goes is right Goes far flies near To the stars away from here Well you do nt know what we can find Why do nt you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride You do nt know what we can see Why do nt you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free Close your eyes girl Look inside girl Let the sound take you away Last night I held Aladdin s lamp And so I wished that I could stay Before the thing could answer me Well someone came and took the lamp away I looked around A lousy candle s all I found Well you do nt know what we can find Why do nt you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride Well you do nt know what we can see Why do nt you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free Close your eyes girl Look inside girl Let the sound take you away You do nt know what we can find Why do nt you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride Well you do nt know what we can see Why do nt you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free

Steppenwolf,1WRM9i067hd2ujxxi8FI3m,Desperation,5HrH5NArWK3oOm5sopaleg, When rain drops fall and you feel low Ah do you ever think it s useless Do you feel like letting go Do you ever sit and do you wonder Will the world ever change And just how long will it take To have it all rearranged Tell me why these things are still the same Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes Take my hand if you do nt know where your goin I ll understand I ve lost the way myself Oh do nt take that old road it leads to nowhere We must return before the clock strikes twelve It s so easy to do nothin When you re busy night and day Take a step in one direction And take a step the other way So do nt stop tryin when you stumble Do nt give up should you fall Keep on searchin for the passway That will lead you through the wall Do nt look back or you ll be left behind Do nt look back or you will never find peace of mind

Steppenwolf,1WRM9i067hd2ujxxi8FI3m,It's Never Too Late,0pzyXz7RlY6l4Uw37m106H, Your eyes are moist you scream and shout As though you were a man possessed From deep inside comes rushing forth All the anguish you suppressed Up on your wall hangs your degree Your parents craved so much for you And though you re trained to make your mark You still do nt quite know what to do It s never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh no not too late It s never too late to start all over again You say you ve only got one life to live And when your dead you re gone Your family comes to your grave And with tears in their eyes They tell you you did something wrong You left us alone Tell me who s to say after all is done And you re finally gone you wo nt be back again You can find a way to change today You do nt have to wait till then It s never too late to start all over again Well it s much to late to start again To try and find a little bliss So on your woman and your child You release your bitterness You drift apart some more each day You feel the guilt and loneliness And the God of your childhood you ca nt find To save you from your emptiness It s never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh no not too late It s never too late to start all over again

Steppenwolf,1WRM9i067hd2ujxxi8FI3m,Foggy Mental Breakdown,3zptHVy08pFqDyfvLFA0wE, Hear me holler down the mountain side I m near the sky blinking at the evil eye Hear me holler at the city s grind It stole my soul just about lost my mind Let the loneliness roll in Like the foggy mountain dew Wipe the madness from my eye Till my anger slowly dies When the shadow play begins I ll be watching through the night Till I find myself again Hear me holler cross the sea of light It took my dream and smashed it gainst the night Hear me holler at the town below Got nothing left to make me stay and no place left to go Let the loneliness roll in Like the foggy mountain dew Wipe the madness from my eye Till my anger slowly dies When the shadow play begins I ll be watching through the night Till I find myself again
