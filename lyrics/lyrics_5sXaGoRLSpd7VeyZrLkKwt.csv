Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Chemicals,6Eyt039etvBOx2V612yu4y, Coffee burns the stomach churns Chemicals and caffeine You saw her bathing in the creek Now you re jealous of the water Now babe if it s alright I call you that I ve been running solo but it ai nt all that They say it s the take and give But emptiness knows just where I live And emptiness knows me Was it just chemicals in my head Tell me why all these pages are flying round in the yard How my hands ca nt seem to find your hands in the dark Tell me tell me how the hell did we get all the way up here How gravity s gone
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,San Luis,7gDNQLV9cr8449LFrQbk5J, Weightlessness no gravity Were we somewhere inbetween I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis mmm Oh highway boys all sleeping in With their dirty mouths and broken strings Oh their eyes are shining like the sea For you the queen of San Luis I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis Cutting through the avenues I d always find my way to you Beside the hook the hammer lies And fumbling round in the smoke Spending time chasing ghosts Hold me down hold me down child Hold me down hold me down child California called you queen With your golden hair and magazine Were you somewhere inbetween Fast asleep a flying dream I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis I m a ghost of you you re a ghost of me A birdseye view of San Luis
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Big Black Car,3Kj2EWpIBnvETsYq4cq0IH, You were a phonograph I was a kid I sat with an ear close just listening I was there when the rain tapped her way down you face You were a miracle I was just holding your space Well time has a way of throwing it all in your face The past she is haunted the future is laced Heartbreak ya know drives a big black car Wear I was in the back seat just minding my own And through the glass the corn crows come like rain They wo nt stay they wo nt stay For too long now This could be all that we know Of love and all Well you were a dancer I was a rag The song in my head well was all that I had Hope was a letter I never could send Love was a country we could nt defend And through the carnival we watch them go round and round All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns Well you were a magazine I was a plain jane Just walking the sidewalks all covered in rain Love to just get into one of your stories Just me in all of my plain jane glory
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,The Stable Song,3G9ETaH55bMQx8hwNhAgbU, Remember when our songs were just like prayers Like gospel hymns that you called in the air Come down come down sweet reverence Unto my simple house and ring And ring Ring like silver ring like gold Ring out those ghosts on the Ohio Ring like clear day wedding bells Were we the belly of the beast or the sword that fell We ll never tell Come to me clear and cold on some sea Watch the world spinning waves like that machine Now I ve been crazy could nt you tell I threw stones at the stars but the whole sky fell Now I m covered up in straw belly up on the table Well I drank and sang and passed in the stable That tall grass grows high and brown Well I dragged you straight in the muddy ground And you sent me back to where I roam Well I cursed and I cried but now I know Now I know And I ran back to that hollow again The moon was just a sliver back then And I ached for my heart like some tin man When it came oh it beat and it boiled and it rang Oh it s ringing Ring like crazy ring like hell Turn me back into that wild haired gale Ring like silver ring like gold Turn these diamonds straight back into coal
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,"If I Go, I'm Goin",1vqtj4c5aNPKkLS2LXkd4E, This house She s holding secrets I got my change behind the bed In a coffee can I throw my nickels in Just in case I have to leave And I will go if you ask me to I will stay if you dare And if I go I m goin shameless I ll let my hunger take me there This house She s quite the talker She creeks and moans She keeps me up And the photographs Know I m a liar They just laugh as I burn her down And I will go if you ask me to I will stay if you dare And if I go I m goin on fire Let my anger take me there The shingles man they re shaking The back door s burning through This house she s quite the keeper Quite the keeper of you I will go if you ask me to I will stay if you dare And if I go I m goin crazy I ll let my darlin take me there
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Dandelion Wine,5AeoHJUx0PJXAzN425xryh, Summer days were just a magazine a magazine A magazine Cutting grass for gasoline for gasoline So I can see ya soon Fall swooned Left me drunk in a field Dandelion wine for a year And I packed up the dust Of all that I owned Handkerchief hung from a pole I rolled out the day that the apples fell
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Virginia May,435XaJ1Mqo5Pd7AwRE7nrF, Slept high up in the Rockies Set my clock for californieyaye And I dreamed up somethin special to give that ocean Man she cuffs me anyway So I m banking on virginia To keep me clear and calm and straight Just like clock work seems to tell us With every passing storm there s just a harder hail So light my way Virginia May I ca nt sit still just pace across this hallway We spent all this time Just trading crimes While the tunesmith packed a lunch He s headed down the coastline There s a loneliness that s blowin Well I heard it from the radio man He s been locked up in the belfry Listening close to a string upon a can Me I m sailin on to that savior She s a pilgrim living on the modern time And ever since I found her magic Now every car or cloud that passes is a sign Light my way Virginia May I ca nt sit still just pace across this hallway We spent all this time Just trading crimes And I m saving all my sleep for another life I m saving all my sleep for another life
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Berth,77A5mKz70kQRtCS6e985RM, Silver winged broken English boys they smoke Talk and joke above the water New York lady holding in her heavy hand Sacred lantern guiding dawn Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Casting glances backwards but it s not your fault Turned to salt for the wandering In your braids and heavy pages we were folded Kiss the cold and dirty ground Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Seasons wake with sleeping birds now flying south Covered mouth we watch in awe Fallen pines to shape the skyline take me there Beneath the barren coloured moon Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Greeting all the masses From their teeming shores She was born with open hands Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back Quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Amsterdam,7iQmjnDXYngWGsbjVnDc1U, All inside our Amsterdam she hides Wateryeyed That howling wind she s waving hi Her other hand s in mine Oh silhouette She s growing tall and fine She s got my back She ll follow me down every street No matter what my crime All inside our Amsterdam she flies Hoarding the kites That howling wind she ll take everything But she s easy on the eyes Churches and trains They all look the same to me now They shoot you some place While we ache to come home somehow
Gregory Alan Isakov,5sXaGoRLSpd7VeyZrLkKwt,Southern Star,6YXbSjabsKQ1pNvj6zcJ9V, Oh my drunken southern star How you tried to hide in darkness Slipped from orbit Now you re dangerously close Come out come out From all your hiding out We ll dig in our heels Salute the battlefields Where our broken hearts were born oh And the storm clouds are thirsty I can see them bursting watch them gathering light And the walls in the bedroom now are pounding out Were we broken open baby maybe just a crack Swore I heard you whisper that you preferred us like that oh My broken open child Were we thirsty thorned with wild eyes Still we are slaves to the sirens of the salty sea
