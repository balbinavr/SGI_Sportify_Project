Portugal. The Man,4kI8Ie27vjvonwaB2ePh8T,Feel It Still,6QgjcU0zLnzq5OrUoSZ3OK, Ca nt keep my hands to myself Think I ll dust em off put em back up on the shelf In case my little baby girl is in need Am I coming out of left field Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now I been feeling it since 1966 now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it s 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still Got another mouth to feed Leave her with a baby sitter mama call the grave digger Gone with the fallen leaves Am I coming out of left field Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now I been feeling it since 1966 now Mighta had your fill but you feel it still Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it s 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still We could fight a war for peace Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now Give in to that easy living Goodbye to my hopes and dreams Stop flipping for my enemies We could wave until the walls come down Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now It s time to give a little tip Kids in the middle move over till it falls Do nt bother me Is it coming Is it coming Is it coming Is it coming Is it coming Is it coming back Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks yeah Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now I ve been feeling it since 1966 now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh I m a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it s 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still Mighta had your fill but you feel it still
