Tedeschi Trucks Band,2gFsmDBM0hkoZPmrO5EdyO,Midnight in Harlem,1ncSAZD0bzvU3cu0uPLbWd, Well I came to the city I was running from the past My heart was bleeding And it hurt my bones to laugh Stayed in the city No exception to the rule He was born to love me I was raised to be his fool Walk that line torn apart Spend your whole life trying Ride that train free your heart It s midnight up in Harlem I went down to the river And I took a look around There were old man s shoes There were needles on the ground No more mysteries baby No more secrets no more clues The stars are out there You can almost see the moon The streets are windy And the subway s closing down Gon na carry this dream To the other side of town
