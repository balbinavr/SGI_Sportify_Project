Lord Huron,6ltzsmQQbmdoHHbLZ4ZN25,The Night We Met,0QZ5yyl6B6utIWkxeBDxQN, I am not the only traveler Who has not repaid his debt I ve been searching for a trail to follow again Take me back to the night we met And then I can tell myself What the hell I m supposed to do And then I can tell myself Not to ride along with you I had all and then most of you Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met I do nt know what I m supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Take me back to the night we met When the night was full of terrors And your eyes were filled with tears When you had not touched me yet Take me back to the night we met I had all and then most of you Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met I do nt know what I m supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Take me back to the night we met

Lord Huron,6ltzsmQQbmdoHHbLZ4ZN25,When the Night is Over,4FE9SgxcOoCNuGnaaU8TXz, My one and only love I ve been lonely long enough Will I find you when the night is over Tell me where did you go I ve been searching high and low I have only til the night is over In every window I pass Your reflection in the glass Makes me wonder if my mind is going Shadows shifting in the rain Slowly driving me insane By the stars above I know we were in love I have only til the night is over I feel the weather change I hear the river say your name I watch the birds fly by I see an emerald in the sky Now the trail has gone cold I do nt know where else to go And my time I fear is nearly over When the ocean drinks the sky And the city winks its eye When the night is done you ll vanish in the sun Will I hold you when the night is over Am I lost inside my mind There s an emerald in the sky I hear the river say your name By the stars above I know we were in love I hear the river say your name I have only til the night is over
