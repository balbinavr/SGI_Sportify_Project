Ccile McLorin Salvant,6PkSULcbxFKkxdgrmPGAvn,Monday,4FYmHTavxSVFUPyM2GUpPb, Let s find a spot Here under the stars With nothing but sky Between you and I Oh how the time seems to stop With your face in my hands With such trickery See how it s flying away And there s nothing i can do but cling to you my love and thank the stars I lived a dream with you Oh how my heart seems to stop When you re here in my arms With such trickery See how it s flying away And there s nothing i can do I lived a dream with you
Ccile McLorin Salvant,6PkSULcbxFKkxdgrmPGAvn,Visions,5N3rW3s7zDsbSxLV3ERubK, People hand in hand Have I lived to see the milk and honey land Where hate s a dream and love forever stands Was this a vision in my mind The law was never passed But somehow men feel they are truly free at last Have we really gone this far through space and time Was this a vision in my mind I m not one who make believes I know the leaves are green They only turn to brown When autumn comes around I know just what I say Today s not yesterday And all things have an ending But what I d like to know Is could a place like this exist so beautiful Or do we have to find our wings and fly away To the vision in our minds I m not one who makes believes I know that leaves are green They only turn to brown When autumn comes around I know just what I say Today s not yesterday And all things have an ending But what I d like to know Is could a place like this exist so beautiful Or do we have to find our winds and fly away To the vision in our minds
