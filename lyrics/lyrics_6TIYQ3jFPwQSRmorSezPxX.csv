for security a year I think my dad s gone crazy yeah Hailie you right Dad s always mad cooped up in the studio yelling at the mic You re sober and bored huh I know About to be 46 years old dog Talkin bout Ima call up Trick Trick Man you sound like a bitch bitch Man up and handle your shit Ugh Mad about something I said in 2012 Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss Homie we get it we know that you re the greatest rapper alive Fucking dweeb all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside Fuck Rap God I m the Rap Devil Coming bear face with a black shovel Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle His body next to this instrumental I m saying I m sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats let s talk about it I m sick of you being rich and you still mad let s talk about it Both of us single dads from the Midwest we can talk about it Or we could get gully I ll size up your body and put some white chalk around it Let s talk about the fact you actually blacked balled a rapper that s twice as young as you Let s talk about it Let s call Sway ask why I ca nt go on Shade 45 because of you Brr Let s ask Interscope how you had Paul Rosenberg trying to shelf me Huh Still ca nt cover up the fact your last four albums is as bad as your selfie Now tell me what do you stand for What I know you ca nt stand yourself No Trying to be the old you so bad you Stan yourself Ha Let s leave all the beefing to 50 Please Em you re pushing 50 Why you claiming that Ima call Puff When you the one that called Diddy Facts Then you went and called Jimmy Facts They

rap game ca nt take a fucking joke Oh you want some fucking smoke What But not literally you ll choke Yeah I ll acknowledge you re the GOAT But I m the Gunner bitch I got you in the scope Brra Do nt have a heart attack now No Somebody help your man s up Help Knees weak of old age The real Slim Shady ca nt stand up I m sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats let s talk about it I m sick of you being rich and you still mad let s talk about it Both of us single dads from the Midwest we can talk about it Or we could get gully I ll size up your body and put some white chalk around it Hello Marshall my name s Colson You should go back to Recovery I know your ego is hurting just knowing that all of your fans discovered me Hi He like Damn he a younger me Except he dresses better and I m ugly Always making fun of me Stop all the thuggery Marshall you living in luxury Damn Look what you done to me dropped an album just because of me Damn you in love with me You got money but I m hungry I like the diss but you wo nt say those lyrics out in front of me Shout out to every rapper that s up under me Know that I ll never do you like this fuckery Still bitter after everyone loves you Pull that wedgie out your dungarees Hey I got ta respect the OGs and I know most of em personally Aye But you re just a bully acting like a baby so I got ta read you a nursery Nursery I m the ghost of the future and you re just Ebenezer Scrooge Facts I said on Flex anyone could get it I ai nt know it would be you I m sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats let s talk about it I m sick of you being rich and you still mad let s talk about it Both of us single dads from the Midwest we can talk about it Or we could get gully I ll size up your body and put some white chalk around it Riding shotty cause I got ta roll this dope It s a fast road when your idols become your rivals Never hesitate to say it to your face I m an asshole Bitch ass motherfucker Oh my god Ronny We know you get nervous Rabbit I see momma s spaghetti all over your sweater I wish you would lose yourself on the record that you made a decade ago they were better According to them you re a national treasure To me you re as soft as a feather The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number just hold her umbrellaellaella I m not afraid okay Oscar the Grouch chill on the couch Fuck You got an Oscar damn can anyone else get some food in their mouth For real They made a movie about you you re in everybody s top ten You re not getting better with time It s fine Eminem put down the pen Or write an apology about the simple fact you had to write a diss to acknowledge me I am the prodigy how could I even look up to you You ai nt as tall as me 58 and I m 64 Seven punches hold your head still Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill You were named after a candy I was named after a gangster brr And do nt be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf s album thank you Thank you I just wan na feed my daughter You tried to stop the money to support her You the one always talk about the action Text me the addy I m pulling up scrappy And I m by fucking myself what s happenin EST captain salute me or shoot me That s what he s gon na have to do to me when he realizes there ai nt shit he could do to me Everybody always hated me this is nt anything new to me Yeah there s a difference between us I got all of my shit without Dre producing me Aye I know you re not used to me Usually one of your disses should ruin me But bitch I m from Cleveland everybody quiet this evening I m reading the eulogy Shh Dropped an album called Kamikaze so that means it killed him Already fucked one rapper s girl this week do nt make me call Kim I m sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats let s talk about it I m sick of you being rich and you still mad let s talk about it Both of us single dads from the Midwest we can talk about it Or we could get gully I ll size up your body and put some white chalk around it
Machine Gun Kelly,6TIYQ3jFPwQSRmorSezPxX,"Home (with Machine Gun Kelly, X Ambassadors & Bebe Rexha)",0OI7AFifLSoGzpb8bdBLLV, Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Someone take me Look I did nt power through the struggle Just to let a little trouble knock me out of my position And interrupt the vision After everything I witnessed after all of these decisions All these miles feet inches They ca nt add up to the distance That I have been through just to get to A place where even if there s no closure I m still safe I still ache from trying to keep pace Somebody give me a sign I m starting to lose faith Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares How did I lose it when I was right there Now I m so far that it feels like it s all gone to pieces Tell me why the world never fights fair I m trying to find Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home It s been a long time coming Someone take me Home hoooome Home home Someone take me Home hoooome Home home Look I ve been through so much pain And it s hard to maintain any smile on my face Cause there s madness on my brain So I got ta make it back but my home ai nt on the map Got ta follow what I m feeling to discover where it s at I need the memory In case this fate is forever just to be sure these last days are better And if I have any enemies To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares How did I lose it when I was right there Now I m so far that it feels like it s all gone to pieces Tell me why the world never fights fair I m trying to find Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Someone take me I found no cure for the loneliness I found no cure for the sickness Nothing here feels like home Crowded streets but I m all alone I found no cure for the loneliness I found no cure for the sickness Nothing here feels like home Crowded streets but I m all alone Someone take me Home hoooome Take me home Home home take me home Someone take me Home hoooome someone someone Nothing here feels like home Home home Someone take me
