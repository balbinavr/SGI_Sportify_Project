Death From Above 1979,18H0sAptzdwid08XGg1Lcj,Freeze Me,7FeeQVg6yID8laNUH0LlX8, Tell me what you think are we in trouble Feelin sorry s never really been my struggle Pickin up the pieces siftin through the rubble Ringin in the new year listenin to the double Are we outside the safe spaces of love Are we in space pinned down to spinnin rocks How you freeze me We re so cold now Tell me where you are am I getting warmer You freeze me with that look when I go undercover Readin me my rights when you were gettin closer I resist arrest until you say it s over Are we outside the safe spaces of sex Are we in space or just feelin weightless How you freeze me We re so cold now How you freeze me We re so cold now Are we outside in space so cold so cold Are we outside in space so cold so cold
Death From Above 1979,18H0sAptzdwid08XGg1Lcj,Caught Up,3V1eNDyIDnEYMd613O9Va8, Tell me one thing you ve lied about Take all our fears and drink them out All the way out It s not the same if we condone each other Swapping out the cheese for something similar The bait and switch of love and logic Take my life please I forgot it Ring the bell and you ll get hard I d come around when I hear that sound I ll come around I m not caught up like all the other guys But I m still caught up on something I m not caught up like all the other guys But I m still caught up on something You you Tell me one thing you care about Take your beliefs and shake them out All the way out The gates are open there s no hope In shutting out the world And fighting over small differences The world and all its discontents Ca nt see the beauty in the present Pass the lucy on the left I d come around when I hear that sound I ll come around She s a stopper keep it double A double love around and make me humble I remember I remember I tied a string around my finger to forget her Echo echo give me a sound Something to remember when I m in the ground Mirror mirror please do nt break I could nt take the bad luck If I never see her face again again again I m not caught up like all the other guys But I m still caught up on something I m not caught up like all the other guys But I m still caught up on something You you I m caught up on you I m caught up on you
