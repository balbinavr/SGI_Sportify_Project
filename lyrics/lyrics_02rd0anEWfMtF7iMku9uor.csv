Reba McEntire,02rd0anEWfMtF7iMku9uor,Fancy,0FtV0YbnnjD7PXpLHFHPhn, I remember it all very well lookin back It was the summer I turned eighteen We lived in a oneroom rundown shack On the outskirts of New Orleans We did nt have money for food or rent To say the least we were hard pressed And Mama d spent every last penny we had To buy me a dancin dress Mama washed and combed and curled my hair And she painted my eyes and lips Then I stepped into a satin dancin dress That had a split on the side clean up to my hip It was red velvet trim and it fit me good Standin back from the lookin glass There stood a woman where A half grown kid had stood She said Now here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down Here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume On my neck then she kissed my cheek And then I saw the tears wellin up in her troubled eyes As she started to speak She looked at our pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said Your Pa s runned off and I m real sick And the baby s gon na starve to death She handed me a heart shaped locket that said To thine own self be true And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high heeled shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin Askin Mama what do I do She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy They ll be nice to you She said Here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down Here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down Lord forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it s up to you Now do nt let me down now Your Mama s gon na move you uptown Well that was the last time I saw my Mama The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ai nt been back But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out Was nt very long till I knew exactly What my mama d been talkin about I knew what I had to do And I made myself this solemn vow I s gon na be a lady someday Though I did nt know when or how But I could nt see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might have been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name She said Here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down Here s your one chance Fancy Do nt let me down It was nt long after a benevolent man Took me in off the streets And one week later I was pourin his tea In a five room hotel suite I charmed a king a congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion And an elegant New York townhouse flat I ai nt done bad Now in this world there s a lot of selfrighteous Hypocrites who call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had But though I ai nt had to worry bout nothin For nigh on fifteen years I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama s voice ringin in my ears She said here s your one chance Fancy do nt let me down Here s your one chance Fancy do nt let me down Lord forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it s up to you Now do nt let me down Your mama s gon na move you uptown Well I guess she did
