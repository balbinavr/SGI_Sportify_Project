The Isley Brothers,53QzNeFpzAaXYnrDBbDrIp,"Footsteps in the Dark, Pts. 1 & 2",1tL5a9jowsWMtn3wkFYsG9, Are we really sure That a love that lasted for so long still endures Do I really care Heyhey let s talk about the distractions going on elsewhere I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark oh in the dark Why I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark oh in the dark ooh My mind just now and then Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been Something up ahead Hey should I keep this same direction or go back instead I I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark oh in the dark Why I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark oh in the dark ooh Honey let s stop fooling around When there s love lost to be found Whoa you know I still care I still care What s the sense of going elsewhere Who feels really sure Can that feeling guarantee your happiness shall endure Do we really care Heyhey let s look at what s been happening try to be more aware I I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark yeah in the dark Why I keep hearing footsteps baby In the dark oh in the dark ooh Yeah hey let s stop bumming around yeah Well when there s love lost lost to be found Whoa honey you know I still care I still care What s the sense of going going elsewhere Oh honey let s stop fooling around running around When there s no love to be found Hey baby you know I still care I still care Oh what s the sense in going going elsewhere
