Jamey Johnson,5yhxqYI0JBwUKfXpSEjiM8,In Color,7CNd7rjfVt74TFlcOcnZgN, I said Grandpa what s this picture here It s all black and white and it ai nt real clear Is that you there He said Yeah I was eleven And times were tough back in 35 That s me and Uncle Joe just tryin to survive A cotton farm in the Great Depression And if it looks like we were scared to death Like a couple of kids just trying to save each other You should ve seen it in color This one here was taken overseas In the middle of hell in 1943 In the winter time you can almost see my breath That was my tail gunner ol Johnny McGee He was a high school teacher from New Orleans And he had my back right through the day we left If it looks like we were scared to death Like a couple of kids just trying to save each other You should ve seen it in color A picture s worth a thousand words But you ca nt see what those shades of gray keep covered You should ve seen it in color And this one is my favorite one This is me and grandma in the summer sun All dressed up the day we said our vows You ca nt tell it here but it was hot that June And that rose was red and her eyes were blue And just look at that smile I was so proud That s the story of my life Right there in black and white And if it looks like we were scared to death Like a couple of kids just trying to save each other You should ve seen it in color Yeah a picture s worth a thousand words But you ca nt see what those shades of gray keep covered You should ve seen it in color Should ve seen it in color
Jamey Johnson,5yhxqYI0JBwUKfXpSEjiM8,High Cost Of Living,73sWpECi7iZrcISLSRxuaH, I was just a normal guy Life was just a nine to five With bills and pressure piled up to the sky She never asked she knew I d been Hangin with my wilder friends Looking for some other way to fly And three days straight was no big feat Could get by with no food or sleep And crazy was becoming my new norm I d pass out on the bedroom floor And sleep right through the calm before the storm My life was just an old routine Every day the same damn thing I could nt even tell I was alive I tell you the high cost of livin Ai nt nothing like the cost of livin high That southern Baptist parking lot Was where I d go to smoke my pot And sit there in my pickup truck and pray And staring at that giant cross Just reminded me that I was lost And it just never seemed to point the way As soon as Jesus turned his back I d find my way across the track Lookin just to score another deal With my back against that damn eight ball I did nt have to think or talk or feel My life was just an old routine Every day the same damn thing I could nt even tell I was alive I tell you the high cost of livin Ai nt nothing like the cost of livin high My whole life went through my head Layin in that motel bed Watchin as the cops kicked in the door I had a job and a piece of land My sweet wife was my best friend But I traded that for cocaine and a whore With my new found sobriety I ve got the time to sit and think Of all the things I had and threw away This prison is much colder than That one that I was locked up in just yesterday My life is just an old routine Every day the same damn thing Hell I ca nt even tell if I m alive I tell you the high cost of livin Ai nt nothing like the cost of livin high I tell you the high cost of livin Ai nt nothing like the cost of livin high
