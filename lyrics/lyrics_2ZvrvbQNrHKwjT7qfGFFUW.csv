Herbie Hancock,2ZvrvbQNrHKwjT7qfGFFUW,I Thought It Was You,0taRW8bPp2xW6ewm6PDMTZ, Just a glance from behind Happened by chance or design The perfume she wore Took me back through a door I had closed long ago Suddenly I thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Remember what we knew I thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Remember when I thought it was you We were young love was new Warm as the sun shining through In your arms it seemed I went back to a dream I had seen long ago Suddenly I thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Remember what we knew I thought it was you Thought it was you Thought it was you Remember when I thought it was you
