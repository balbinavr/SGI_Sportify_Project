The Who,67ea9eGLXYMsO2eYQRui3w,Baba O'Riley,5voO100jVn9PK4NUETgM8W, Out here in the fields I fight for my meals I get my back into my living I do nt need to fight To prove I m right I do nt need to be forgiven Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Do nt cry Do nt raise your eye It s only teenage wasteland Sally take my hand We ll travel south cross land Put out the fire and do nt look past my shoulder The exodus is here The happy ones are near Let s get together before we get much older Teenage wasteland It s only teenage wasteland Teenage wasteland oh yeah Teenage wasteland They re all wasted
The Who,67ea9eGLXYMsO2eYQRui3w,Pinball Wizard,60C8zGPTdAAmDshHnMuyfc, Ever since I was a young boy I ve played the silver ball From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all But I ai nt seen nothing like him In any amusement hall That deaf dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball He stands like a statue Becomes part of the machine Feeling all the bumpers Always playing clean Plays by intuition The digit counters fall That deaf dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball He s a pinball wizard There has to be a twist A pinball wizards Got such a supple wrist How do you think he does it I do nt know What makes him so good Ai nt got no distractions Ca nt hear no buzzers and bells Do nt see no lights are flashin Plays by sense of smell Always gets a replay Never seen him fall That deaf dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball I thought I was The Bally table king But I just handed My pinball crown to him Even on my favorite table He can beat my best His disciples lead him in And he just does the rest He s got crazy flipper fingers Never seen him fall That deaf dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball
The Who,67ea9eGLXYMsO2eYQRui3w,Behind Blue Eyes,5wzYIbYrLZ3OiLCUyYISc2, No one knows what it s like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes No one knows what it s like To be hated To be fated To telling only lies But my dreams they are nt as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours only lonely My love is vengeance That s never free No one knows what it s like To feel these feelings Like I do And I blame you No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain and woe Can show through But my dreams they are nt as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours only lonely My love is vengeance That s never free When my fist clenches crack it open Before I use it and lose my cool When I smile tell me some bad news Before I laugh and act like a fool And if I swallow anything evil Put your finger down my throat And if I shiver please give me a blanket Keep me warm let me wear your coat No one knows what it s like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes
