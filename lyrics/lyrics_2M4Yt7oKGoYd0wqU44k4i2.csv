Travis Tritt,2M4Yt7oKGoYd0wqU44k4i2,Same Old Train,5KMWwtJv3Ll2ROZfMerQs0, Well I got on in Bristol by the old Virginia line With a suitcase full of dreams And a brand new spendin dime I had a bouquet of music wrapped in pretty words Singin songs sent down from Heaven On the wings of a speckled bird Wings of a speckled bird I heard a guitar and a fiddle banjo and mandolin An old man opened up the door and told me come on in He took my ticket then he told me Bring what it is you do Cause that s how you ll be remembered When your travelin days are through When your travelin days are through They came from the hills and mountains The valleys and the plains Some were kind and gentle And some too wild to tame A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine It s the same old train it s just a different time Just a different time We sung songs in war we sung songs in peace We traveled in abundance and we traveled on relief From the outer gates of Heaven to hell fire s burnin door It do nt matter where you take it Cause it s been there before It s been there before They came from the hills and mountains The valleys and the plains Some were kind and gentle And some too wild to tame A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine It s the same old train it s just a different time Just a different time Now like a precious treasure that s immeasurable in worth We stand before a new wave proud children of the earth We ll go on forever and here s your solid proof As long as there s a world we ve got ta sing Those folks the truth Sing those folks the truth They came from the neon cities The suburbs and the towns From Bakersfield to Baltimore It s sacred holy ground A string of fearless hearts on an endless ball of twine It s the same old train it s just a different time Just a different time Just a different time Just a different time It s the same old train it s just a different time Same old train just a different time
