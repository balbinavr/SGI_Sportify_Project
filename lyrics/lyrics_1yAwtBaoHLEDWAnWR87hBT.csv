Modest Mouse,1yAwtBaoHLEDWAnWR87hBT,The World At Large,5op53ANI4exiWqFHKuwWxd, Iceage heatwave ca nt complain If the world s at large why should I remain Walked away to another plane Gon na find another place maybe one I can stand I move on to another day To a whole new town with a whole new way Went to the porch to have a thought Got to the door and again I could nt stop You do nt know where and you do nt know when But you ve still got your words and you ve got your friends Walkin on to another day Work a little harder work another way Well uhuh baby I ai nt got no plan Well I ll float on maybe would you understand Gon na float on maybe would you understand We ll all float on maybe would you understand The days get shorter and the nights get cold I like the autumn but this place is getting old I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast It might not be a lot but I feel like I m making the most The days get longer and the nights smell green I guess it s not surprising but it s spring and I should leave I like songs about drifters books about the same They both seem to make me feel a little less insane Walked on off onto another spot I still have nt gotten anywhere that I want Did I want love did I need to know Why does it always feel like I m caught in an undertow Moths beat themselves to death against the lights Adding their breeze to the summer nights Outside water like air was grey I did nt know what I had that day Walk a little farther to another plan You said that you did but you did nt understand I know that starting over s not what life s about But my thoughts were so loud I could nt hear my mouth My thoughts were so loud I could nt hear my mouth My thoughts were so loud
Modest Mouse,1yAwtBaoHLEDWAnWR87hBT,Missed the Boat,4asjU3sDnn3002bTJIg2vZ, While we re on the subject could we change the subject now I was knocking on your ears door but you were always out Looking towards the future we were begging for the past Well we know we had the good things but those never seemed to last Oh please just last Everyone s unhappy everyone s ashamed Well we all just got caught looking at somebody else s page Well nothing ever went quite exactly as we planned Our ideas held no water but we used them like a dam Oh and we carried it all so well As if we got a new position Oh and I laugh all the way to hell Saying Yes this is a fine promotion Oh and I laugh all the way to hell Of course everyone goes crazy over such and such and such We made ourselves a pillar but we just used it as a crutch We were certainly uncertain at least I m pretty sure I am Well we did nt need the water but we just built that good goddamn Oh and I know this of myself I assume as much for other people Oh and I know this of myself We ve listened more to life s end gong Than the sound of life s sweet bells Was it ever worth it was there all that much to gain Well we knew we missed the boat and we d already missed the plane And we did nt read the invite we just danced at our own wake All our favorites were playing so we could shake shake shake shake shake Tiny curtains open and we heard the tiny clap of little hands A tiny man would tell a little joke and get a tiny laugh from all the folks Sitting drifting around in bubbles and thinking it was us that carried them When we finally got it figured out that we had truly missed the boat Oh and we carried it all so well As if we got a new position Oh and we owned all the tools ourselves Without the skills to make a shelf with Oh what useless tools ourselves

Modest Mouse,1yAwtBaoHLEDWAnWR87hBT,"The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box",5o5R70FLhegu7hpsTHAybE, Open up a window All the air oh the air it s falling out Eyes vacuum up light Sound gets trapped by the mouth We ll deal with the remainder When the dents the dents get hammered out Then we ll travel through time The world s an inventor with its work Crawling running squirming round Trees drop colorful fruits Directly into our mouths The world s an inventor We re the dirtiest thing it s thought about And we really do nt mind We ll probably never get there Bring your sight seers school teachers down It s a water color weekend All the trees are turning colors now We ll probably never get there Bring your candy taster time wasters around And we ll fuck with their minds The world composes with its Shirttails wrinkled hanging out Bang us together see what sort Of sounds we make right now The world plays music Playing skin on teeth inside of a mouth What sort of sounds What lovely sounds come about We greased all the ropes we re a part of the ground We ll throw you a line it s above the ground We re gon na break these boulders we re a part of the ground We re gon na travel time when things come together We greased all the ropes come bubbling outwards We ll throw you a line and then sink back We re gon na break these boulders come bubbling outwards We re gon na travel time when things come together We re gon na throw a party All the ghosts of trees are coming out Do nt look any direction Wait until the light s inside of the clouds You re gon na wan na see this Do nt bring your camera around Watch sun and sawdust align We greased all the ropes come bubbling outwards We ll throw you a line and sinking back We re gon na break these boulders we re a part of the ground We re gon na travel time when things come together We greased all the ropes come bubbling outwards We ll throw you a line and run around We re gon na break these boulders come bubbling outwards We re gon na travel time and then sink back Close up the window All the air the air is falling out Eyes vacuum up light Sound gets trapped by the mouth Our predecessor left this box And something s clawing around I think it really wants out
