Vic Damone,4seoDLqmOLUf59y72WJP7g,Linger Awhile,6lqKvDEvIyI8U4axfffdnR, The time is coming soon to say goodbye A time of sadness it will be But honey listen to my parting sigh And linger on awhile with me The stars shine above you Yet linger awhile They whisper I love you Oh linger awhile And when you have gone away Every hour seems like a day I ve something to tell you Oh linger awhile The stars shine above you Yet linger awhile They whisper I love you Oh linger awhile And when you have gone away Every hour seems like a day I ve something to tell you Oh linger awhile Yes linger awhile
