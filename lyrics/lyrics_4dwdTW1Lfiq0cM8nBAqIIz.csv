Of Monsters and Men,4dwdTW1Lfiq0cM8nBAqIIz,Little Talks,2ihCaVdNZmnHZWt0fvAM7B, I do nt like walkin around this old and empty house So hold my hand I ll walk with you my dear The stairs creak as you sleep it s keepin me awake It s the house telling you to close your eyes And some days I ca nt even dress myself It s killing me to see you this way Cause though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore There s an old voice in my head that s holdin me back Well tell her that I miss our little talks Soon it will be over and buried with our past We used to play outside when we were young And full of life and full of love Some days I do nt know if I am wrong or right Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear Cause though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Do nt listen to a word I say The screams all sound the same Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore You re gone gone gone away I watched you disappear All that s left is a ghost of you Now we re torn torn torn apart there s nothin we can do Just let me go we ll meet again soon Now wait wait wait for me please hang around I ll see you when I fall asleep Do nt listen to a word I say The screams all sound the same Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Do nt listen to a word I say The screams all sound the same Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Of Monsters and Men,4dwdTW1Lfiq0cM8nBAqIIz,Dirty Paws,5g7rJvWYVrloJZwKiShqlS, Jumpin up and down the floor My head is an animal And once there was an animal It had a son that mowed the lawn The son was an okay guy They had a pet dragonfly The dragonfly it ran away But it came back with a story to say Her dirty paws and furry coat She ran down the forest slopes The forest of talkin trees They used to sing about the birds and the bees The bees had declared a war The sky was nt big enough for them all The birds they got help from below From dirty paws and the creatures of snow So for a while things were cold They were scared down in their holes The forest that once was green Was colored black by those killing machines But she and her furry friends Took down the queen bee and her men And that s how the story goes The story of the beast with those four dirty paws
Of Monsters and Men,4dwdTW1Lfiq0cM8nBAqIIz,Crystals,5wU6jk9kxYzFGUpeE6T2Q5, Lost in skies of powdered gold Caught in clouds of silver ropes Showered by the empty hopes As I tumble down Fallin fast to the ground I know I ll wither So peel away the bark Cause nothing Grows when it is dark In spite of all my fears I can see it all so clear I see it all so clear Cover your crystal eyes And feel the tones that tremble down your spine Cover your crystal eyes And let your colours bleed and blend with mine Makin waves in pitch black sand Feel the salt dance on my hands Raw and charcoalcoloured thighs Feel so cold and my skin Feels so paperthin I know I ll wither So peel away the bark Cause nothing Grows when it is dark In spite of all my fears I can see it all so clear I see it all so clear Cover your crystal eyes And feel the tones that tremble down your spine Cover your crystal eyes And let your colours bleed and blend with mine But I m okay In seethrough skin I forgive what is within Cause I m in this house I m in this home All my time Cover your crystal eyes And feel the tones that tremble down your spine Cover your crystal eyes And let your colours bleed and blend with mine
Of Monsters and Men,4dwdTW1Lfiq0cM8nBAqIIz,Mountain Sound,60ZGteAEtPCnGE6zevgUcd, I heard them calling in the distance So I packed my things and ran Far away from all the trouble I had caused with my two hands Alone we traveled Armed with nothing but a shadow We fled far away Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Some had scars and some had scratches It made me wonder about their past And as I looked around I began to notice That we were nothing like the rest Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran We sleep until the sun goes down We sleep until the sun goes down We sleep until the sun goes down Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran
