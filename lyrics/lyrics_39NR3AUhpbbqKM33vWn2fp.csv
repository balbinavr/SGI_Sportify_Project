Brothers Osborne,39NR3AUhpbbqKM33vWn2fp,While You Still Can,67e8Sj98Ke3mqayhEZwyAX, Make amends with that old friend You swore you d never never talk to again Because you miss him Call up your mom on the telephone Talk a whole lot of nothing til the cows come home And listen Cross every T dot most the Is Cause years grow wings and fly on by And time slips through your fingers just like sand Because everything you thought would last forever Never lasts forever like you plan Do nt let your night become another So take life by the hands while you still can Get your daddy to tell that same old joke And laugh between the jack and coke And hope one day you ll be half as funny Count your blessings and your stars It s in the air and who you are It s about the wealth you give It sure as hell ai nt about the money Because everything you thought would last forever Never lasts forever like you plan Do nt let your night become another So take life by the hands while you still can You just imagine Anything can happen if you live every moment like your last Because everything you thought would last forever Never lasts forever like you plan Do nt let your night become another So take life by the hands while you still can
