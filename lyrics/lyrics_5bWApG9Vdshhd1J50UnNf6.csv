Blossom Dearie,5bWApG9Vdshhd1J50UnNf6,They Say It's Spring,7spdOASg2r8uR473H5zLXV, When I was young I lived in a world of dreams Of moods and myths and illusionary schemes Though now I m much more grown up I fear that I must own up To the fact that I m in doubt of What the modern cynics shout of They say it s spring This feeling light as a feather They say this thing This magic we share together Came with the weather too They say it s May That s made me daft as a daisy It s May they say That gave the whole world this crazy Heavenly hazy hue I m a lark On the wing I m the spark of a firefly s fling Yet to me This must be Something more than a seasonal thing Could it be spring Those bells that I can hear ringing It may be spring But when the robins stop singing You re what I m clinging to Though they say it s spring It s you If poets sing That when a hard sympathetic It s merely spring Then poets plights are pathetic Though I m poetic too They say it s spring For lovers there s where the lure is That evil thing For which September the cure is This they are sure is true Though I know That it s so That my fancy may turn in the spring With the right One in sight One can find a perpetual thing Did I need spring To bring the ring that you bought me Though it was spring That wondrous day that you caught me Darling I thought we knew That it was nt spring Twas you
