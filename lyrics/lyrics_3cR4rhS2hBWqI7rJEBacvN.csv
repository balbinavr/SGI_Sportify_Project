harmony And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany This colonys economys increasingly stalling and Honestly thats why public service Seems to be calling me He s just nonstop I practiced the law I practicly perfected it Ive seen injustice in the world and Ive corrected it Now for a strong central democracy If not then Ill be Socrates Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities Awww Hamilton at the Constitutional Convention I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention There as a New York junior delegate Now what Im going to say may sound indelicate Awwww Goes and proposes his own form of government What His own plan for a new form of government What Talks for six hours The convention is listless Bright young man Yo who the f is this Why do you always say what you believe Why do you always say what you believe Evry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies Awww Why do you write like its Going out of style Write day and night like its Going out of style Evry day you fight like its Going out of style Do what you do Alexander Aaron Burr sir Its the middle of the night Can we confer sir Is this a legal matter Yes and its important to me What do you need Burr youre a better lawyer than me Okay I know I talk too much Im abrasive Youre incredible in court Youre succinct persuasive My client needs a strong defense Youre the solution Whos your client The new US Constitution No Hear me out No way A series of essays anonymously published Defending the document to the public No one will read it I disagree And if it fails Burr thats why we need it The constitutions a mess So it needs amendments Its full of contradictions So is independence We have to start somewhere No No way Youre making a mistake Good night Hey What are you waiting for What do you stall for What We won the war What was it all for Do you support this constitution Of course Then defend it And what if youre backing the wrong horse Burr we studied and we fought and we killed For the notion of a nation we now get to build For once in your life take a stand with pride I dont understand how you stand to the side Ill keep all my plans close to my chest Wait for it wait for it wait Ill wait here and see which way the wind will blow Im taking my time watching the afterbirth of a nation Watching the tension grow I am sailing off to London Im accompanied by someone who always pays I have found a wealthy husband Who will keep me in comfort for all my days He is not a lot of fun but theres no one Who can match you for turn of phrase My Alexander Angelica Dont forget to write Look at where you are Look at where you started The fact that youre alive is a miracle Just stay alive that would be enough And if your wife could share a fraction of your time If I could grant you peace of mind Would that be enough Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution entitled The Federalist Papers The plan was to write a total of twentyfive essays the work divided evenly among the three men In the end they wrote eightyfive essays in the span of six months John Jay got sick after writing five James Madison wrote twentynine Hamilton wrote the other fiftyone How do you write like youre running out of time Write day and night like youre running out of time Evry day you fight like youre running out of time Like youre running out of time Are you running out of time Awwww How do you write like tomorrow wont arrive How do you write like you need it to survive How do you write evry second youre alive Evry second youre alive Evry second youre alive They are asking me to lead I am doing the best I can To get the people that I need Im asking you to be my right hand man Treasury or State I know its a lot to ask Treasury or State To leave behind the world you know Sir do you want me to run the Treasury or State department Treasury Lets go Alexander I have to leave Alexander Look around look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now Helpless They are asking me to lead Look around isnt this enough He will never be satisfied What would be enough He will never be satisfied to be
