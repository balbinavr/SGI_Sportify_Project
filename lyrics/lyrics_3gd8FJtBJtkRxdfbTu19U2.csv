Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,Guiding Light,63J2iqaDDp92P1eZgvuELp, 1 2 3 All day permanent red The glaze on my eyes When I heard your voice The distance caught me by surprise again And I know you claim That you re alright But fix your eyes on me I guess I m all you have And I swear you ll see the dawn again Well I know I had it all on the line But do nt just sit with folded hands and become blind Cause even when there is no star in sight You ll always be my only guiding light Relate to my youth Well I m still in awe of you Discover some new truth That was always wrapped around you But do nt just slip away In the night Do nt just hurl Your words from on high Well I know I had it all on the line But do nt just sit with folded hands and become blind Cause even when there is no star in sight You ll always be my only guiding light If we come back and we re broken Unworthy and ashamed Give us something to believe in And you know we ll go your way Cause I know I had it all on the line But do nt just sit with folded hands and become blind Cause even when there is no star in sight You ll always be my only guiding light And I know I had it all on the line But do nt just sit with folded hands and become blind Cause even when there is no star in sight You ll always be my only guiding light
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,Beloved,5V0nHhlYIjUMfcSoJ5ziRD, Austere enthroned in white grandeur But tired a shift A whisper of where you sailed ahead From your eyes I d never seen you unkempt before As you whispered darling close the door Well how have I not made a note of every word You ever said Time is not on our side But I pretend that it s alright She says the Lord has a plan But admits it s pretty hard to understand Before you leave you must know you are beloved And before you leave remember I was with you Are you afraid How ever could you not be In this rosy light This is strange I feel a hand come through the mirror Pointing at the light Pointing at the light we never see As you put your feathered arms over me Before you leave you must know you are beloved And before you leave remember I was with you And as you leave I wo nt hold you back beloved And talk the stars down from the sky Down forget the chaos in your eyes love And as you leave you must know you are beloved And as you leave I can see the wild has come for you And as you leave I wo nt hold you back beloved And as you leave see my children playing at your feet
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,I Will Wait,2JHBMVs8E7bJJBLkXpKgHn, Well I came home Like a stone And I fell heavy into your arms These days of dust Which we ve known Will blow away with this new sun But I ll kneel down Wait for now And I ll kneel down Know my ground And I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you So break my step And relent Well you forgave and I wo nt forget Know what we ve seen And him with less Now in some way shake the excess Cause I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you Now I ll be bold As well as strong And use my head alongside my heart So tame my flesh And fix my eyes A tethered mind freed from the lies And I ll kneel down Wait for now I ll kneel down Know my ground woo We ll raise my hands Paint my spirit gold And bow my head Keep my heart slow Cause I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you And I will wait I will wait for you
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,The Cave,3pLTOP0G0etiWUknFoRpsr, It s empty in the valley of your heart The sun it rises slowly as you walk Away from all the fears And all the faults you ve left behind The harvest left no food for you to eat You cannibal you meateater you see But I have seen the same I know the shame in your defeat But I will hold on hope And I wo nt let you choke On the noose around your neck And I ll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I ll know my name as it s called again Cause I have other things to fill my time You take what is yours and I ll take mine Now let me at the truth Which will refresh my broken mind So tie me to a post and block my ears I can see widows and orphans through my tears I know my call despite my faults And despite my growing fears And I will hold on hope And I wo nt let you choke On the noose around your neck And I ll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I ll know my name as it s called again So come out of your cave walking on your hands And see the world hanging upside down You can understand dependence When you know the maker s land So make your siren s call And sing all you want I will not hear what you have to say Cause I need freedom now And I need to know how To live my life as it s meant to be And I will hold on hope And I wo nt let you choke On the noose around your neck And I ll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I ll know my name as it s called again
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,Woman,7pEUVoZDoQg4NQwmMcyjhQ, Woman Cupped hand is burning ice Tangled up in morning white Do you ever really know Can you ever really know Woman Watch her take me by surprise When she lets me call her mine Do you ever really know Can you ever really know And I do nt know the loneliness she long I do nt hear the frosty words that call inside When you re gone again I ca nt read your mind though I m trying all the time There s something I do nt know I can see it in your eyes As the night descends it s always slow again I am left in awe of the woman I adore Woman I never had such a sign Burn itself into my mind Do you ever really know Can you ever really know You say the sun does nt shine for you I hope you re learning that s not true in time When you re gone again Just as long again I ca nt read your mind though I m trying all the time There s something I do nt know I can see it in your eyes As the night descends oh it s always slow again But I am left in awe of the woman I adore I ca nt read your mind though I m trying all the time There s something I do nt know I can see it in your eyes And as the night descends it s always slow again But I am left in awe of the woman I adore
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,42,1xjIDl9Eh5lBMjIRqMnAZL, Where do I turn to when there s no choice to make And how do I presume when there s so much at stake I was so sure of it all But what if I need you in my darkest hour And what if it turns out there is no other If this is our last hope We would see a sign oh We would see a sign Well I ve been running from the ashes we left Forgiveness speaks for itself but how can I forget When there s a stain on it all But what if I need you in my darkest hour What if it turns out there is no other We had it all If this is our time now We wan na see a sign oh We would see a sign So give us a sign I need some guiding light Children of darkness oh

Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,The Wild,4W3LpDT8Z1DrlzOrLUkoo4, We saw birth and death Ca nt we be still What makes you kind From where comes your sparkling mind Was it under the earth Tied up in a knot Which I forgot you were ever there Do not be afraid Do not be afraid What s that I see I think it s the wild Puts the fear of God in me And was there a grudge Up from the dust Inconceivable lie What s that I see I think it s the wild Puts the fear of God in me
Mumford & Sons,3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2,October Skies,3JD5xfa8pgJi0AzdRCRETW, In the silver light I just made out Your silhouette Through the quickening haze So brand it on my mind So I do nt forget Let it shine On my wandering eyes And ooh your love endures And ooh I have faith for the rest I m blinded by the lights Of October skies These postcard memories Evade my eyes And in the valley I am free But in the hills I soar Until your silhouette Is gone once more And ooh your love endures Ooh I have hope once more The fear of what s to come Has been crippling me So to your silhouette I turn once more So brand it on my mind So I wo nt forget Let it shine Let it shine By my wandering eyes Let it shine Let it shine By my wandering eye Ooh your love endures Ooh I have hope once more
