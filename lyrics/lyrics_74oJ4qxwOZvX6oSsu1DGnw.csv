Cream,74oJ4qxwOZvX6oSsu1DGnw,White Room,3Xls4cNOwy01dtrNXb1inG, In the white room with black curtains near the station Blackroof country no gold pavements tired starlings Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes Dawnlight smiles on you leaving my contentment I ll wait in this place Where the sun never shines Wait in this place Where the shadows run from themselves You said no strings could secure you at the station Platform ticket restless diesels goodbye windows I walked into such a sad time at the station As I walked out felt my own need just beginning I ll wait in the queue When the trains come back Lie with you Where the shadows run from themselves At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd Consolation for the old wound now forgotten Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes She s just dressing goodbye windows tired starlings I ll sleep in this place With the lonely crowd Lie in the dark Where the shadows run from themselves

Cream,74oJ4qxwOZvX6oSsu1DGnw,Tales Of Brave Ulysses,2mKY3LWyyLYgz3aFsHQk83, You thought the leaden winter Would bring you down forever But you rode upon a steamer To the violence of the sun And the colors of the sea Blind your eyes with trembling mermaids And you touch the distant beaches With tales of brave Ulysses How his naked ears were tortured By the sirens sweetly singing For the sparkling waves are calling you To kiss their whitelaced lips And you see a girl s brown body Dancing through the turquoise And her footprints make you follow Where the sky loves the sea And when your fingers find her She drowns you in her body Carving deep blue ripples In the tissues of your mind The tiny purple fishes Run laughing through your fingers And you want to take her with you To the hard land of the winter Her name is Aphrodite And she rides a crimson shell And you know you can not leave her For you touched the distant sands With tales of brave Ulysses How his naked ears were tortured By the sirens sweetly singing The tiny purple fishes Run laughing through your fingers And you want to take her with you To the hard land of the winter
