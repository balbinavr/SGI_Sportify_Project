Trent Tomlinson,1Zn69emN3uZsF6YwCrkgYp,One Wing In The Fire,338arfXmD9XaESFjfcQLsg, Daddy s been a backrow Baptist With his share of frontrow sin His Saturday night still on his breathe Every Sunday when he d walk in He s never led the Benediction He s never sang in the choir But he s an angel with no halo An one wing in the fire Mamma lives by the Bible The Bible lives by the bed An she s lied alone so many nights With scriptures in her head Prayin Good Lord just be with him I know his Faith is tired But he s an angel with no halo An one wing in the fire An I know he lives a little left of livin right An he s come close to goin way to far a few times But I d trade a thousand prayers If just one prayer would come true Lord please believe in him like I believe in you Daddy s always been there for me From TBall to touchdowns Fixed my car an fixed my heart When they ve been broken down I know he calls for more forgiveness Than most folks do require But he s an angel with no halo An one wing in the fire An I know he lives a little left of livin right An he s come close to goin way to far a few times But I d trade a thousand prayers If just one prayer would come true Lord please believe in him like I believe in you Well I just ca nt imagine What Heaven might be like If me an Mamma make it Without Daddy by our side Lord could you please remember When it s time to call us higher That he s an angel with no halo An one wing in the fire
