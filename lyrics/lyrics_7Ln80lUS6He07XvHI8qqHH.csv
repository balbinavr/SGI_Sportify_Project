Arctic Monkeys,7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH,Do I Wanna Know?,5FVd6KXrgO9B3JPmC8OPst, Have you got colour in your cheeks Do you ever get that fear that you ca nt shift The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth Are there some aces up your sleeve Have you no idea that you re in deep I dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep Cause there s this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow And I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep Spilling drinks on my settee Do I wan na know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sort of hoping that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you ca nt say tomorrow day Crawlin back to you Ever thought of calling when you ve had a few Cause I always do Maybe I m too Busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now I ve thought it through Crawlin back to you So have you got the guts Been wondering if your heart s still open And if so I wan na know what time it shuts Simmer down and pucker up I m sorry to interrupt It s just I m constantly on the cusp Of trying to kiss you But I do nt know if you feel the same as I do But we could be together if you wanted to Do I wan na know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sort of hoping that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you ca nt say tomorrow day Crawlin back to you Ever thought of calling when you ve had a few Cause I always do Maybe I m too busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now I ve thought it through Crawlin back to you Do I wan na know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sort of hoping that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you ca nt say tomorrow day Do I wan na know Too busy being yours to fall Sad to see you go Ever thought of calling darling Do I wan na know Do you want me crawling back to you
