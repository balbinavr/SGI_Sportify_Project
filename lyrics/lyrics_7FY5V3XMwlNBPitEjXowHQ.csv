Darius Rucker,7FY5V3XMwlNBPitEjXowHQ,For The First Time,0LG2cFomCi8Fb664Lvr3Nu, You say you never danced to a dashboard singin REM under summer stars Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy blowing smoke rings in the dark You do nt want to be a rumor girl and I feel just the same Yeah I know that you do nt know me well but we can make that change When was the last time you did something for the first time Yeah let yourself go follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you re needing Like a real life let your hair down feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine run barefoot through the mud Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips while you watched the sun come up Well I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove But give me just half a chance girl I m daring you When was the last time you did something for the first time Yeah let yourself go baby follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you re needing Like a real life let your hair down feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time Now the way you re looking says you re living I hope I ai nt reading wrong Cause the way you re shining I think you re thinking It s been way too long When was the last time you did something for the first time Yeah yeah let yourself go come on follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you re needing Like a real life let your hair down feel alive alive When was the last time oh you did something for the first time girl Come on baby When was the last time yeah you did something for the first time
