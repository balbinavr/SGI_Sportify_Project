Upchurch,2pSObt5Fk8izuX8ZfI3jRn,Rolling Stoned,28B02YJaBMp2byqoM9H92n, Church Sometimes I get stoned in my backyard Lay off in the tall grass so my view is of stars I think about nothing get to clear my thoughts From all the thunder and lightning so I feel a spark Sometimes I get higher than the Colorado Rockies Hoping that the county sheriff do nt stop me Like Charlie Daniels said you should nt smoke that dope But damn it I ca nt help I love rolling stoned With the windows rolled down and the radio up Sweet tea full in my Solo cup Listenin to the hummin of the 44s Soundin like a concert out my beat up door Arm hanging out the window smiling away Smoking on some grown where the cattle graze Charlie Daniels said you should nt go smoke that dope But hell I ca nt help I love rolling stoned Yeah I love rolling stoned Smoke rolling round the cab with the dome light on Lookin like a stage for a Lynyrd Skynyrd song Hangin out with Mary Jane but she s makin the time go slow Makin memories with my buddies through the thick green smoke Puff passing out the windows of my old Tahoe Lifted so damn high I ca nt come down Drivin under the speed limit in my town With the windows rolled down and the radio up Sweet tea full in my Solo cup Listenin to the hummin of the 44s Soundin like a concert out my beat up door Arm hanging out the window smiling away Smoking on some grown where the cattle graze Charlie Daniels said you should nt go smoke that dope But hell I ca nt help I love rolling stoned Yeah I love rolling stoned There ai nt nothing like the swaying of a windy back road Baked out like a barn full of tobacco I know Jesus drank wine but I bet he would nt mind Sittin with me in my Chevy passin round a few times With the windows rolled down the radio up Sweet tea full in our Solo cups Listenin to the hummin of the 44s Like a concert out my beat up door Arm hanging out the window smiling away Smoking on some grown where the cattle graze Ol Willie said there s nothing wrong with smokin dope So light one up and lets go rolling stoned So pass me that and lets start rolling stoned
