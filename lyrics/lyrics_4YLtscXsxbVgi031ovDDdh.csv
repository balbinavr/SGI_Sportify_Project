Chris Stapleton,4YLtscXsxbVgi031ovDDdh,Broken Halos,06gD2ZtK3Dzc1BYqWExQJJ, Seen my share of broken halos Folded wings that used to fly They ve all gone wherever they go Broken halos that used to shine Angels come down from the heavens Just to help us on our way Come to teach us then they leave us And they find some other soul to save Seen my share of broken halos Folded wings that used to fly They ve all gone wherever they go Broken halos that used to shine Broken halos that used to shine Do nt go looking for the reasons Do nt go asking Jesus why We re not meant to know the answers They belong to the by and by They belong to the by and by Seen my share of broken halos Folded wings that used to fly They ve all gone wherever they go Broken halos that used to shine Broken halos that used to shine Broken halos that used to shine Broken halos that used to shine
Chris Stapleton,4YLtscXsxbVgi031ovDDdh,Parachute,5jROdl6MhcmP3O7h2sVgtw, Streetlights along the highway Throwing shadows in the dark And the memories keep on turning To the rhythm of a broken heart You only need a roof when it s raining You only need a fire when it s cold You only need a drink when the whiskey Is the only thing that you have left to hold Sun comes up and goes back down And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground Say the word and I ll be there for you Baby I will be your parachute There s a song that I remember I never learned to play And a lifetime of forgotten words I never got to say You only need a roof when it s raining You only need a fire when it s cold You only need a drink when the whiskey Is the only thing you have left to hold Sun comes up and goes back down And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground Say the word and I ll be there for you Baby I will be your parachute parachute If you think you re going down Just know I will be around You only need a roof when it s raining You only need a fire when it s cold You only need a drink when the whiskey Is the only thing you have left to hold Sun comes up and goes back down And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground Say the word and I ll be there for you Baby I will be your Baby I will be your parachute parachute
