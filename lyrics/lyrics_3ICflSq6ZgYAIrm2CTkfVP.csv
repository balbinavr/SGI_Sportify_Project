The Animals,3ICflSq6ZgYAIrm2CTkfVP,House Of The Rising Sun,7BY005dacJkbO6EPiOh2wb, There is a house in New Orleans They call the Rising Sun And it s been the ruin of many a poor boy And God I know I m one My mother was a tailor Sewed my new blue jeans My father was a gamblin man Down in New Orleans Now the only thing a gambler needs Is a suitcase and trunk And the only time that he s satisfied Is when he s on a drunk Oh mother tell your children Not to do what I have done Spend your lives in sin and misery In the House of the Rising Sun Well I ve got one foot on the platform The other foot on the train I m going back to New Orleans To wear that ball and chain Well there is a house in New Orleans They call the Rising Sun And it s been the ruin of many young poor boy And God I know I m one

The Animals,3ICflSq6ZgYAIrm2CTkfVP,"It's All over Now, Baby Blue",55Jty4lzy6jnC3Cm9h8bQQ, You must leave now take what you need you think will last But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast Yonder stands your orphan with his gun Crying like a fire in the sun Look out the saints are comin through And it s all over now baby blue The highway is for gamblers better use your sense Take what you have gathered from coincidence The empty handed painter from your streets Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets This sky too is folding under you And it s all over now baby blue All your seasick sailors they are rowing home Your empty handed armies are all going home Your lover who just walked out the door Has taken all his blankets from the floor The carpet too is moving under you And it s all over now baby blue Leave your stepping stones behind there s something that calls for you Forget the dead you ve left they will not follow you The vagabond who s rapping at your door Is standing in the clothes that you once wore Strike another match go start a new And it s all over now baby blue
