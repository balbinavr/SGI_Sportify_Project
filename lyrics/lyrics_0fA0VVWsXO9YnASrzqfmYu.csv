Kid Cudi,0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu,Soundtrack 2 My Life,1cdC9TCqyLwAlsw3fVJaJS, I got 99 problems and they all bitches Wish I was Jigga man carefree living But I m not Sean or Martin Louis I m that Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn Boys You know what I be when you start living large I control my own life Charles was never in charge No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom On Christmas time my mom Christmas grind Got me most of what I wanted How d you do it mom huh She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself Why he by himself He got two older brothers one hood one good An independent older sister kept my fly when she could But they all did nt see the little bit of sadness in me Scotty I ve got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions are pouring outta me I bring them to the light for you it s only right This is The Soundtrack 2 my life yeah yeah The Soundtrack 2 my life oh I m super paranoid like a 6th sense Since my father died I ai nt been right since And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe Split a 8th of shrooms just so I can see the universe I try to think about myself as a sacrifice Just to show the kids they ai nt the only ones who up at night The moon will illuminate my room and soon I m consumed by my doom Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck it s all said and done and my cock s been sucked So now I m in the cut alcohol in the wound My hearts an open sore that I hope heals soon I live in a cocoon opposite of Cncun Where it s never sunny the dark side of the moon So its more than right I try and shed some light on a man Not many people of this planet understand fam I ve got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions keep pouring outta me I bring them to the light for you it s only right This is The Soundtrack 2 my life The Soundtrack 2 my life oh I m prolly this close to go and tryin some coke And the happy ending would be slitting my throat Ignorance to cope man Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is love and I need that shit If I never did shows then I d prolly be a myth If I cared about the blogs then I d prolly be a jackass Do nt give a shit what people talk about fam Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck Hope I really get to see 30 Wan na settle down stop being so flirty Most of the clean faces be the most dirty I just need a thoroughbred cook when I m hungry Ass all chunky brain is insanity Only things that calm me down pussy and some cali tree And I get both never truly satisfied I am happy that s just the saddest lie I ve got some issues that nobody can see And all of these emotions keep pouring outta me I bring them to the light for you it s only right This is The Soundtrack 2 my life The Soundtrack 2 my life oh
