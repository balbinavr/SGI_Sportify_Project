Mansionair,4qOzMSukiZoiSjPQw8Zs7s,Violet City,1irXmwdCbngOtucJNd5mSl, Wide awake in this violet city Where it washes over me It hurts to say that I want you with me Just draped across my frame I ca nt help myself The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control in control I need something else The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control in control In control in control I ca nt help myself The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control I m in control In a maze of my expectation I just feel so far away Holding on to these empty spaces As I try to find my way Cause I m somewhere else Surrounded by the city shelf Trying to appease all my desires Cause I m somewhere else Believe me I m beside myself I ve been trying to change I ca nt help myself The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control in control I need something else The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control I m in control I ca nt help myself The moment that I let it go Is when I find I m in control in control Is when I find I m in control in control

Mansionair,4qOzMSukiZoiSjPQw8Zs7s,Technicolour,3oIflAW8crVuSGYVGkyneC, We dive into the blue I ca nt hold onto you Staring the illusion in the eye And when the colors blur We forget who we were And all we need is technicolour And I lost my grip And all we need is technicolour I give into it We were in love We were in love Oh we were in love We were in love And all we need is technicolour We dip into the pool Cold water covers you It s draining all the color from your eyes And as we start to fade Your lips they turn to grey When all we need is technicolour And I know my lack of love will drown itself And I know I can not keep what was nt found Cause the fire s out that used to burn in me Close your eyes to see what s really happening We were in love We were in love Oh we were in love Oh we were in love And all we need is technicolour And all we need is technicolour And all we need is technicolour
