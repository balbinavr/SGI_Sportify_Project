Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Scott Street,0jqFM7E9z1PLYtPVCuFwAi, Walking Scott Street feeling like a stranger With an open heart open container I ve got a stack of mail and a tall can It s a shower beer it s a payment plan There s helicopters over my head Every night when I go to bed Spending money and I earned it When I m lonely that s when I ll burn it Do you feel ashamed When you hear my name I asked you How is your sister I heard she got her degree And I said That makes me feel old He said What does that make me I asked you How is playing drums You said it s too much shit to carry And what about the band You said they re all getting married Do you feel ashamed When you hear my name Anyway do nt be a stranger Anyway do nt be a stranger Do nt be a stranger
Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Motion Sickness,6LxcPUqx6noURdA5qc4BAT, I hate you for what you did And I miss you like a little kid I faked it every time but that s alright I can hardly feel anything I hardly feel anything at all You gave me fifteen hundred To see your hypnotherapist I only went one time you let it slide Fell on hard times a year ago Was hoping you would let it go and you did I have emotional motion sickness Somebody roll the windows down There are no words in the English language I could scream to drown you out I m on the outside looking through You re throwing rocks around your room And while you re bleeding on your back in the glass I ll be glad that I made it out And sorry that it all went down like it did I have emotional motion sickness Somebody roll the windows down There are no words in the English language I could scream to drown you out And why do you sing with an English accent I guess it s too late to change it now You know I m never gon na let you have it But I will try to drown you out You said when you met me you were bored You said when you met me you were bored And you you were in a band when I was born I have emotional motion sickness I try to stay clean and live without And I want to know what would happen If I surrender to the sound Surrender to the sound

Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Souvenir,1JPRgRUK044O15wgv8uZO1, Dreamcatcher in the rearview mirror Hasnt caught a thing yet Twenty dollars on a souvenir Anythings worth trying To stay out of your nightmares Few hours in your dream last night Always end up dying You said because of course I did Oohohoh Oohohoh Always managed to move in Right next to cemeteries And never far from a hospital I dont know what that tells you about me Pulling thorns out of my palm Work a midnight surgery When you cut a hole into my skull Do you hate what you see Like I do Oohohoh Oohohoh Oohohoh Oohohoh Oohohoh
Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Me & My Dog,4q9w3UGW3utmeUruBLUoZZ, We had a great day Even though we forgot to eat And you had a bad dream Then we got no sleep Cause we were kissing I had a fever Until I met you Now you make me cool But sometimes I still do Something embarrassing I never said I d be all right Just thought I could hold myself together But I could nt breathe I went outside Do nt know why I thought it d be any better I m fine now it does nt matter I did nt wan na be this guy I cried at your show with the teenagers Tell your friend I ll be all right In the morning it wo nt matter I wan na be emaciated I wan na hear one song without thinking of you I wish I was on a spaceship Just me and my dog and an impossible view I dream about it And I wake up falling
Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Smoke Signals,5g97GAdru7XfeJyJhViIll, I went with you up to The place you grew up in We spent a week in the cold Just long enough to Walden it with you Any longer it would have got old Singing Ace of Spades when Lemmy died But nothing s changed LA s all right Sleeping in my bed again and getting in my head And then walk around the reservoir You you must have been looking for me Sending smoke signals Pelicans circling Burning trash out on the beach One of your eyes is Always halfshut Something happened when you were a kid I did nt know you then And I ll never understand Why it feels like I did How Soon Is Now in an 80s sedan You slept inside of it because your dad Lived in a campground in the back of a van You said that song will creep you out until you re dead And you must have been looking for me Sending smoke signals Pelicans circling Burning trash out on the beach I want to live at The Holiday Inn Where somebody else makes the bed We ll watch TV while The lights on the street Put all the stars to death It s been on my mind since Bowie died Just checking out to hide from life And all of our problems I m gon na solve em With you riding shotgun speeding cause fuck the cops And you you must have been looking for me Sending smoke signals Pelicans circling Burning trash out on the beach I buried a hatchet It s coming up lavender The future s unwritten The past is a corridor I m at the exit looking back through the hall You are anonymous I am a concrete wall
Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,Demi Moore,333xp1EUizwmpNf4fZYClT, Take a dirty picture babe I ca nt sleep and I miss your face In my hands and in my knees Tell me what you wan na do to me Tell me what you ll do please I do nt wan na be alone I do nt wan na be alone anymore You got quiet on the other line Said the sun was coming up And I laughed until I could nt breathe Now I m too tired to go to sleep Now I ca nt breathe and I ca nt sleep I do nt wan na be stoned I do nt wan na be stoned anymore Do nt wan na be alone Do nt wan na be alone anymore I could feel alone I could I got a good feeling It does nt happen very often
Phoebe Bridgers,1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG,"Ketchum, ID",6SBITkcYSlE5hz0ZpoFZ8f, Back in the States now In a college town I would walk around But its really coming down Mesmerized by double lines Two yellow tightropes Im making good time I am never anywhere Anywhere I go When Im home Im never there Long enough to know Being in love is the same thing as being alone Giving the sorrow some company Nothing to say stay on the phone Im sorry I do not know what else you want from me I am never anywhere Anywhere I go When Im home Im never there Long enough to know You say How are you I say I dont know Lets dissolve the band move to Idaho Everyones around and I hear you smiling You say I love you I say You too I am never anywhere Anywhere I go When Im home Im never there Long enough to know Oohohohoh Oohohohoh I am never anywhere Anywhere I go When Im home Im never there Long enough
