Steely Dan,6P7H3ai06vU1sGvdpBwDmE,Do It Again,2BstRQGodshjGpeDGQiNgo, In the morning you go gunning For the man who stole your water And you fire till he is done in But they catch you at the border And the mourners are all singing As they drag you by your feet But the hangman is nt hanging And they put you on the street Yeah you go back Jack do it again Wheel turnin round and round You go back Jack do it again When you know she s no high climber Then you find your only friend In a room with your twotimer And you re sure you re near the end Then you love a little wild one And she brings you only sorrow All the time you know she s smiling You ll be on your knees tomorrow Yeah you go back Jack do it again Wheel turnin round and round You go back Jack do it again Now you swear and kick and beg us That you re not a gambling man Then you find you re back in Vegas With a handle in your hand Your black cards can make you money So you hide them when you re able In the land of milk and honey You must put them on the table Yeah you go back Jack do it again Wheel turnin round and round You go back Jack do it again

Steely Dan,6P7H3ai06vU1sGvdpBwDmE,Deacon Blues,7Hx2EA4wGaxtsiZCVVLV1i, This is the day of the expanding man That shape is my shade there where I used to stand It seems like only yesterday I gazed through the glass At ramblers wild gamblers That s all in the past You call me a fool you say it s a crazy scheme This one s for real I already bought the dream So useless to ask me why throw a kiss and say goodbye I ll make it this time I m ready to cross that fine line Learn to work the saxophone I I play just what I feel Drink Scotch whisky all night long And die behind the wheel They got a name for the winners in the world I I want a name when I lose They call Alabama the Crimson Tide Call me Deacon Blues Deacon Blues My back to the wall a victim of laughing chance This is for me the essence of true romance Sharing the things we know and love with those of my kind Libations sensations That stagger the mind I crawl like a viper through these suburban streets Make love to these women languid and bittersweet I ll rise when the sun goes down cover every game in town A world of my own I ll make it my home sweet home Learn to work the saxophone I I play just what I feel Drink Scotch whisky all night long And die behind the wheel They got a name for the winners in the world I I want a name when I lose They call Alabama the Crimson Tide Call me Deacon Blues Deacon Blues This is the night of the expanding man I take one last drag as I approach the stand I cried when I wrote this song sue me if I play too long This brother is free I ll be what I want to be I ll learn to work the saxophone I I play just what I feel Drink Scotch whisky all night long And die behind the wheel They got a name for the winners in the world I I want a name when I lose They call Alabama the Crimson Tide Call me Deacon Blues Deacon Blues
