Tom Misch,1uiEZYehlNivdK3iQyAbye,Movie,6pxElwU80zhjbCC77Vn8EI, Polly Misch My cheek brushes against his Smooth on stubble for a moment And then it s gone He walks along the platforms into the dream Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream Stop To run across to him take him into my arms To tell him I love you You silly silly man I love you But instead I stand still Heart cracking The little curls on the back of his head bouncing As he steps out of my life forever I hope That the fire we both made Still burns a little in you I wrote to you Everyday did my letters find their way Our memories on my screen Two lovers in this mystic dream Baby come back to me come back to me Too much time on my phone Baby do you still sleep alone Come back to me come back to me Remember me Fresh out a black and white movie movie On every screen What would you realize What you meant to me or was it mystery Remember me Fresh out a black and white movie movie On every screen What would you realize What you meant to me was a mystery I heard That you moved somewhere far away Is your number the same as before Ca nt ignore the time May have changed your ways Does my record still hang on your wall Such a sentimental way to groove I hope it still touches you Baby come back to me come back to me It kills me to see you leave So I came home and made this beat Baby come back to me come back to me Remember me Fresh out a black and white movie movie On every screen What would you realize What you meant to me was a mystery Remember me Fresh out a black and white movie movie On every screen What would you realize What you meant to me was a mystery Remember me let s set the scene You and me what could ve been Still swimming in a lover s dream Still playing on the movie screens Remember me let s set the scene You and me what could ve been Still swimming in a lover s dream Still playing on the movie screens Remember me let s set the scene You and me what could ve been Still swimming in a lover s dream Still playing on the movie screens Remember me let s set the scene You and me what could ve been Still swimming in a lover s dream Still playing on the movie screens
Tom Misch,1uiEZYehlNivdK3iQyAbye,Disco Yes,61Ivix5DTnDPVjp1dgLyov, Tom Misch I want to stay But I need to go I want to be the best for you But I just do nt know what to do Cause baby say I ve cried for you The time we have spent together Riding through this English weather And as the pressure builds So does the tension between you and me Time has gone so fast Watching the leaves fall from our tree Baby I just want you to know I still love you Love you Love you Love you Poppy Ajudha And the grass is always greener On the other side Maybe you should come and take a trip sometime Oh you seem keener When they turn to night But you trippin out your mind Tell me it s a sign As the pressure builds So does the tension between you and me Time has gone so fast Time has gone so fast Watching the leaves fall from our tree Baby I just want you to know I still love you Love you Love you Love you
Tom Misch,1uiEZYehlNivdK3iQyAbye,It Runs Through Me,02CygBCQOIyEuhNZqHHcNx, Tom Misch 1 2 3 4 I love the way it flows I love the way it grows There s something in this sound that takes me far It s like a special song Can move my mood along But I can not say you ll hear through my guitar She told me add a bassline And everything will be alright She told me that the groove is mine It will take us through the night And where I ll go Ca nt explain I ll never know But it s beautiful You ca nt take this away from me The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me You ca nt take this away from me The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me I love the way it sings All the joy that it brings Remember skating down the road towards the park I can never say no You with that summer glow The music gives me sun when winter starts She told me add a bassline And everything will be alright She told me that the beat is mine It will rock us through the night And where I ll go Ca nt explain I ll never know But it s beautiful You ca nt take this away from me oh The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me You ca nt take this away from me oh The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me Tom Misch De La Soul You ca nt take this away from me oh The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me You ca nt take this away from me oh The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me Posdnuos Yo I wear notes like coats Blues like doos warm from the rhythm soul that glues That bounce to my bones that jazz in my spine The hop is my home rap is my grind I m grindin on the back side of life we dance She threw me a chance her hands in my pants Actually my pockets holdin me tight whispering a dream I could hold in the night Look tight a rhythm that s throbbin my veins Wake up and write it on a pad the pains Like church the organ will invite the tears Like birth I m cryin let you know I m here Held by the song that gave me a name Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim There s just a bass in the line safe to inhale And if you re well Belonger years in this state you will be A timeless octave to play for the tree That s rooted in every single nerve in me The nerve of he who ignores the key And use it to open the minds that be free Whenever you re hot head ignores you you are free Beneath the clouds you allowed to see in clarity through harmony Someone harmin me That wo nt be done I stand protected by the laws of fun I am perfected through the rhymes of Run Walkin this way and leave the party stunned This music it launched me With no aim I ve landed with some plane Where I am I ca nt explain or ever know But it s beautiful so Tom Misch Posdnuos You ca nt take this away from me The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me You ca nt take this away from me The way I hit a melody The waves bring clarity Running through me
