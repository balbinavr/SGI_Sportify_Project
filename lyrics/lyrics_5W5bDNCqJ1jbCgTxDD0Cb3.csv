Willie Nelson,5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3,Highwayman,6uvT4Di9ZRBw5cbexZJDts, Willie Nelson I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive But I am still alive Kris Kristofferson I was a sailor I was born upon the tide And with the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still Waylon Jennings I was a dam builder Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound But I am still around I ll always be around and around and around and around and around Johnny Cash I ll fly a starship Across the Universe divide And when I reach the other side I ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I ll be back again and again and again and again and again

Willie Nelson,5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3,Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,2uRVPeQbsEpRQD0DKr1WTo, In the twilight glow I see her Blue eyes crying in the rain When we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we d never meet again Love is like a dying ember And only memories remain And through the ages I ll remember Blue eyes crying in the rain Someday when we meet up yonder We ll stroll hand in hand again In the land that knows no parting Blue eyes crying in the rain

Willie Nelson,5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3,Good Hearted Woman,38jwN2vvBU7CjrySrZ9t35, A long time forgotten Are dreams that just felt by the way And the good life he promised Is not what she s living to day But she never complains of The bad times or bad things he s done She s just talks about the good times They ve had and all the good times to come She s a good hearted woman In love with a good timin man And she loves him in spite of his ways That she do nt understand And through teardrops and laughter They ll pass though his world hand in hand This good hearted woman In love with her good timin man Now he likes the night life The brightlights and good timin friends And when the party s all over She welcome him back home again Though she do nt understand him She does the best that she can This good hearted woman In love with her good timin man She s a good hearted woman In love with a good timin man And she loves him in spite of his ways That she do nt understand And through teardrops and laughter They ll pass though his world hand in hand This good hearted woman In love with her good timin man She s a good hearted woman In love with a good timin man And she loves him in spite of his ways That she do nt understand
Willie Nelson,5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3,Frosty the Snowman,4HMptEInOi2qAZHRh8MCMj, Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day So he said let s run and have some fun now before I melt away Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye saying do nt you cry I ll be back again some day
Willie Nelson,5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3,Seven Spanish Angels (With Ray Charles),7i59jjqTqjNvEbDW2H8Z7R, He looked down into her brown eyes And said Say a prayer for me She threw her arms around him Whispered God will keep us free They could hear the riders comin He said This is my last fight If they take me back to Texas They wo nt take me back alive There were seven Spanish angels At the altar of the sun They were prayin for the lovers In the valley of the gun When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared There was thunder from the throne And seven Spanish angels Took another angel home She reached down and picked the gun up That lay smokin in his hand She said Father please forgive me I ca nt make it without my man And she knew the gun was empty And she knew she could nt win But her final prayer was answered When the rifles fired again There were seven Spanish angels At the altar of the sun They were prayin for the lovers In the valley of the gun When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared There was thunder from the throne And seven Spanish angels Took another angel home There were seven Spanish angels At the altar of the sun They were prayin for the lovers In the valley of the gun When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared There was thunder from the throne And seven Spanish angels Took another angel home There were seven Spanish angels At the altar of the sun They were prayin for the lovers In the valley of the gun When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared There was thunder from the throne woah yeah And seven Spanish angels Took another angel home
