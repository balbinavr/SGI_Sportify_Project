The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Cleopatra,2ToW7zhGCrVrLU4fiKj9U1, I was Cleopatra I was young and an actress When you knelt by my mattress and asked for my hand But I was sad you asked it as I laid in a black dress With my father in a casket I had no plans And I left the footprints the mud stained on the carpet And it hardened like my heart did when you left town But I must admit it that I would marry you in an instant Damn your wife I d be your mistress just to have you around But I was late for this late for that Late for the love of my life And when I die alone when I die alone When I die I ll be on time While the church discouraged any lust that burned within me Yes my flesh it was my currency but I held true So I drive a taxi and the traffic distracts me From the strangers in my backseat they remind me of you But I was late for this late for that Late for the love of my life And when I die alone when I die alone When I die I ll be on time And the only gifts from my Lord Were a birth and a divorce But I ve read this script and the costume fits So I ll play my part I was Cleopatra I was taller than the rafters But that s all in the past now gone with the wind Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom It s a bed and a bathroom and a place for the end I wo nt be late for this late for that Late for the love of my life And when I die alone when I die alone When I die I ll be on time ah
The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Nobody Knows,7A0FGrZsLgOUmeNtMTnt4z, Nobody knows how to say goodbye It seems so easy til you try Then the moments passed you by Nobody knows how to say goodbye Nobody knows how to get back home And we set out so long ago Search the heavens and the Earth below Nobody knows how to get back home Through the darkness to the dawn And when I looked back you were gone Heard your voice leading me on Through the darkness to the dawn Love is deep as the road is long And moves my feet to carry on It beats my heart when you are gone Love is deep as the road is long Nobody knows how the story ends Live the day doing what you can This is only where it began Nobody knows how the story ends Nobody knows how the story ends
The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Walls,3UpEsDQyd6eyRQzgQdNyGo, Some days are diamonds Some days are rocks Some doors are open Some roads are blocked Sundowns are golden And they fade away But if I never do nothing I ll get you back someday Cause you got a heart so big It could crush this town And I cant hold out forever Even walls fall down And all around your island There s a barricade It keeps out the danger It holds in the pain Sometimes you re happy Sometimes you cry Half of me is ocean Half of me is sky But you got a heart so big It could crush this town And I cant hold out forever Even walls fall down Some things are over Some things go on Part of me you carry Part of me is gone But you got a heart so big It could crush this town And I ca nt hold out forever Even walls fall down Baby you got a heart so big It could crush this town And I ca nt hold out forever Even walls fall down
The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Angela,5bodDpPolC3xlame0SVcDY, When you left this town with your windows down And the wilderness inside Let the exits pass all the tar and glass Till the road and sky align The strangers in this town They raise you up just to cut you down Oh Angela it s a long time coming And your Volvo lights lit up green and white With the cities on the signs But you held your course to some distant war In the corners of your mind And from the second time around The only love I ever found Oh Angela it s a long time coming Home at last Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms With your fingers in a fist Did you hear the notes all those static codes In the radio abyss The strangers in this town They raise you up just to cut you down Oh Angela it s a long time coming Oh Angela spent your whole life running away Home at last Home at last Vacancy hotel room Lost in me lost in you Angela on my knees I belong I believe Home at last Home at last Home at last Home at last Home at last Mmm
The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Flowers in Your Hair,3Hvg5tRKsQlX25wYwgMF9p, When we were younger we thought Everyone was on our side Then we grew a little bit And romanticized the time I saw Flowers in your hair It takes a boy to live It takes a man to pretend he was there So then we grew a little and knew a lot And how we demonstrated it to the cops And all the things we said We were selfassured Cause it s a long road to wisdom But it s a short one To being ignored Be in my eyes Be in my heart Be in my eyes ai yai yai And be in my heart So now I think that I could Love you back And I hope it s not too late cause you re attractive And the way you move I wo nt close my eyes It takes a man to live It takes a woman to make him compromise Be in my eyes Be in my heart Be in my eyes ai yai yai And be in my heart
The Lumineers,16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg,Visions of China,5yWCq9N7kIy6DpqXnGilSG, Twisty sidewalks female taxi drivers Dirty fingers pink houses light up And if there s just one thing You wanted to see I suggest you keep looking Find out for once Find out for once Find out for once Count the bikes Strange violin Barter price smoking inside Stray cat walks broken English Chairman s eye living billions And if there s just one thing You wanted to see I suggest you keep looking Find out for once Find out for once Find out for once
