Count Basie,2jFZlvIea42ZvcCw4OeEdA,The Best Is Yet To Come,3HXdy2r9RzawSwqQCwkjnP, Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum You came along And everything s startin to hum Still it s a real good bet The best is yet to come Best is yet to come and babe Wo nt that be fine You think you ve seen the sun But you ai nt seen it shine AWait till the warmup s underway Wait till our lips have met And wait till you see that sunshine day You ai nt seen nothin yet The best is yet to come and babe Wo nt it be fine Best is yet to come Come the day you re mine Come the day you re mine I m gon na teach you to fly We ve only tasted the wine We re gon na drain the cup dry Wait till your charms are right For these arms to surround You think you ve flown before but baby You ai nt left the ground AWait till you re locked in my embrace Wait till I draw you near AWait till you see that sunshine place Ai nt nothin like it here The best is yet to come and babe Wo nt it be fine The best is yet to come Come the day you re mine Come the day you re mine And you re gon na be mine
Count Basie,2jFZlvIea42ZvcCw4OeEdA,Pennies From Heaven,4JvJYTZkgm6yUUl4H8sk4C, Every time it rains it rains Pennies from heaven Do nt you know each cloud contains Pennies from heaven You ll find your fortune falling all over the town Make sure that your umbrella is upside down Trade them for a package sunshine and flowers If you want the things you love You must have showers So when you hear it thunder dont run under a tree There ll be pennies from heaven for you and me Band Break Trade ithem for a package of sunshine and flowers If you want the things you love You must have showers So when you hear it thunder Do nt run under a tree There ll be pennies from heaven for you and me
