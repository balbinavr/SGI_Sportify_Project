Fleet Foxes,4EVpmkEwrLYEg6jIsiPMIb,Helplessness Blues,4UkynNKM3QAFnYukL8Udi6, I was raised up believing I was somehow unique Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes Unique in each way you d conceive And now after some thinking I d say I d rather be A functioning cog in some great machinery Serving something beyond me But I do nt I do nt know what that will be I ll get back to you someday soon you will see What s my name what s my station Oh just tell me what I should do I do nt need to be kind to the armies of night That would do such injustice to you Or bow down and be grateful And say Sure take all that you see To the men who move only in dimlylit halls And determine my future for me And I do nt I do nt know who to believe I ll get back to you someday soon you will see If I know only one thing It s that every thing that I see Of the world outside is so inconceivable Often I barely can speak Yeah I m tongue tied and dizzy And I ca nt keep it to myself What good is it to sing helplessness blues Why should I wait for anyone else And I know I know you will keep me on the shelf I ll come back to you someday soon myself If I had an orchard I d work till I m raw If i had an orchard I d work till I m sore And you would wait tables And soon run the store Gold hair in the sunlight My light in the dawn If I had an orchard I d work till I m sore If I had an orchard I d work till I m sore Someday I ll be Like the man on the screen
Fleet Foxes,4EVpmkEwrLYEg6jIsiPMIb,Icicle Tusk,0Hg7k4fgqHFYPQrB1UKUZu, I ll shoot you dead For the father Of the coal miner s daughter Beneath the icicle tusk You and me among the flattering dusk In my haste I draw my weapon Designing your final lesson As you recede to the floor All is silent but the fluttering door Twentyfive grand on the table Of the high wall street stable I m not responsible for The reputation of the Neighborhood whore But I m a keyhole peeker And you re my surveilance keeper And though my memory rusts I will always see the icicle tusk And I must admit That it gets lonesome on my shelf This much I can tell This much I can tell
