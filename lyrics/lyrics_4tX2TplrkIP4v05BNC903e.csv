Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,4tX2TplrkIP4v05BNC903e,American Girl,7MRyJPksH3G2cXHN8UKYzP, Well she was an American girl Raised on promises She could nt help thinking that There was a little more to life Somewhere else After all it was a great big world With lots of places to run to Yeah and if she had to die Tryin she Had one little promise she was gon na keep Oh yeah alright Take it easy baby Make it last all night make it last all night She was an American girl Well it was kind of cold that night She stood alone on the balcony Yeah she could hear the cars roll by Out on 441 like Waves crashing on the beach And for one desperate moment there He crept back in her memory God it s so painful when something that s so close Is still so far out of reach Oh yeah alright Take it easy baby Make it last all night make it last all night She was an American girl
