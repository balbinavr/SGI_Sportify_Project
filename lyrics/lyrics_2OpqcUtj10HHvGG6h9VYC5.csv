George Jones,2OpqcUtj10HHvGG6h9VYC5,He Stopped Loving Her Today,6qMgx8ys4MNNxypaIvbG0i, He said I ll love you til I die She told him You ll forget in time As the years went slowly by She still preyed upon his mind He kept her picture on his wall Went halfcrazy now and then He still loved her through it all Hoping she d come back again Kept some letters by his bed Dated nineteen sixtytwo He had underlined in red Every single I love you I went to see him just today Oh but I did nt see no tears All dressed up to go away First time I d seen him smile in years He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they ll carry him away He stopped loving her today You know she came to see him one last time Oh and we all wondered if she would And it kept running through my mind This time he s over her for good He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they ll carry him away He stopped loving her today
George Jones,2OpqcUtj10HHvGG6h9VYC5,The Race Is On,1q0SkvboXCdVQauHBzVr9z, I feel tears wellin up cold and deep inside Like my heart s sprung a big break And the stab of loneliness sharp and painful That I may never shake Now you might say that I was taking it hard Since you wrote me off with a call But do nt you wager that I ll hide the sorrow When I may break right down and bawl Now the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch Heartache s agoin to the inside My tears are holdin back They re tryin not to fall My heart s out of the runnin True love s scratched for another s sake The race is on and it looks like Heartaches And the winner loses all One day I had ventured in love never once suspectin What the final results would be How I lived in fear of wakin up each morning And finding that you d gone from me There s aching and pain in my heart For the day was the one that I hated to face Somebody new came up to win her And I came out in second place Now the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch Heartache s agoin to the inside My tears are holdin back They re tryin not to fall My heart s out of the runnin True love s scratched for another s sake The race is on and it looks like Heartaches And the winner loses all

George Jones,2OpqcUtj10HHvGG6h9VYC5,The Grand Tour,5MBbDg00tK6jlhAcZuUnoC, Step right up come on in If you d like to take the grand tour Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home I have nothing here to sell you Just some things that I will tell you Some things I know will chill you to the bone Over there sits the chair Where she d bring the paper to me And sit down on my knee And whisper oh I love you But now she s gone forever And this old house will never Be the same without the love That we once knew Straight ahead that s the bed Where we d lay in love together And Lord knows we had a good thing going here See her picture on the table Do nt it look like she d be able Just to touch me and say good morning dear There s her rings all her things And her clothes are in the closet Like she left them When she tore my world apart As you leave you ll see the nursery Oh she left me without mercy Taking nothing but Our baby and my heart Step right up come on in

George Jones,2OpqcUtj10HHvGG6h9VYC5,Tennessee Whiskey,0NNnrpB0y0H7G2JoMVerQq, I used to spend my nights out in a bar room Liquor was the only love I ve known But you rescued me from reaching For the bottle And you brought me back from Being too far gone You re as smooth as Tennessee whiskey You re as sweet as strawberry wine You re as warm as a glass of brandy And I stay stoned on your love all the time I looked for love in all the same old places Found the bottom of the bottle always dry But when you poured out your heart I did nt waste it Cause there nothing like your love To get me high You re as smooth as Tennessee whiskey You re as sweet as strawberry wine You re as warm as a glass of brandy And I stay stoned on your love all the time I stay stoned on your love all the time
