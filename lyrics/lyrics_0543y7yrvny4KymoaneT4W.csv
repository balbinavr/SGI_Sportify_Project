Peter Frampton,0543y7yrvny4KymoaneT4W,Show Me The Way,6BD1X1PeV5UzYUdiVaD2yL, I wonder how you re feeling There s ringing in my ears And no one to relate to except the sea Who can I believe in I m kneeling on the floor There has to be a force Who do I phone The stars are out and shining But all I really want to know Oh wo nt you show me the way every day I want you to show me the way yeah Well I can see no reason You re living on your nerves When someone drops a cup and I submerge I m swimming in a circle I feel I m going down There has to be a fool to play my part Well someone thought of healing But all I really want to know Oh wo nt you show me the way every day I want you to show me the way oh I want you day after day yeah Yeah I wonder if I m dreaming I feel so unashamed I ca nt believe this is happening to me I watch you when you re sleeping And then I want to take your love Oh wo nt you show me the way every day I want you to show me the way one more time I want you day after day yeah I want you day after day hey I want you to show me the way every day I want you to show me the way night and day I want you day after day
Peter Frampton,0543y7yrvny4KymoaneT4W,While My Guitar Gently Weeps,3AecLVrPzZwaQwfWSJQFWW, I look at you all See the love there that s sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor And I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps I do nt know why nobody told you How to unfold your love I do nt know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you I look at the world and I notice it s turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I do nt know how you were diverted You were perverted too I do nt know how you were inverted No one alerted you I look at you all See the love there that s sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I Look at you all Still my guitar gently weeps
