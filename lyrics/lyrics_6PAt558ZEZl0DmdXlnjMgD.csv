Eric Clapton,6PAt558ZEZl0DmdXlnjMgD,My Father's Eyes,7zXqmgoZNRHNFgFAOoxhx6, Sailing down behind the sun Waiting for my prince to come Praying for the healing rain To restore my soul again Just a toerag on the run How did I get here What have I done When will all my hopes arise How will I know him When I look in my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes When I look in my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes Then the light begins to shine And I hear those ancient lullabies And as I watch this seedling grow Feel my heart start to overflow Where do I find the words to say How do I teach him What do we play Bit by bit I ve realized That s when I need them That s when I need my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes That s when I need my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes Then the jagged edge appears Through the distant clouds of tears I m like a bridge that was washed away My foundations were made of clay As my soul slides down to die How could I lose him What did I try Bit by bit I ve realized That he was here with me I looked into my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes I looked into my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes My father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes I looked into my father s eyes Look into my father s eyes My father s eyes
