Lil Peep,2kCcBybjl3SAtIcwdWpUe3,Life is Beautiful,5rYpwP1dHWGVMrSZbTmt3e, I know that it hurts sometimes but it s beautiful Workin every day now you bleedin through your cuticles Passin through a portal as you re just sittin in your cubicle Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather s funeral Findin out eventually the feelin was nt mutual You were not invited cause you re nothin like the usual Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful You wan na see your friends but you re stuck inside a hospital Doctor walks in and he tells you that it s terminal Tumor in your brain and they say that It s inoperable Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful They ll kill your little brother and they ll tell you he s a criminal They ll fuckin kill you too so you better not get physical Welcome to America that type of shit is typical Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful Wake up in the mornin now you doin the impossible Find out what s important now you feelin philosophical When I die I ll pack my bags move somewhere more affordable Is nt life horrible I think that life is horrible You think she s adorable she thinks that you re intolerable You think you can do it but your chances are improbable Once you feel unstoppable you run into an obstacle Is nt life comical I think that life is comical And if you ever need a friend then you got me And in the end when I die would you watch me And if I tried suicide would you stop me Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me Runaway make friends with the moon Why you trippin You ll be with your friends soon There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate I think Ima die alone inside my room Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful Is nt life beautiful I think that life is beautiful
