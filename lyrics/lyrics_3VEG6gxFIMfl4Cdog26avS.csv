Bill Evans Trio,3VEG6gxFIMfl4Cdog26avS,My Foolish Heart,6yKkA8HzwWTZ5taIMaG4Nm, The scene is set for dreaming Love s knocking at the door But oh my heart I m reluctant to start For we ve been fooled before The night is like a lovely tune Beware my foolish heart How white the ever constant moon Take care my foolish heart There s a line between love and fascination That s hard to see on an evening such as this For they both give the very same sensation When you are lost in the magic of a kiss Her lips are much too close to mine Beware my foolish heart But should our eager lips combine Then let the fire start For this time it is nt fascination Or a dream that will fade and fall apart It s love this time it s love my foolish heart For this time it is nt fascination Or a dream that will fade and fall apart It s love this time it s love my foolish heart
Bill Evans Trio,3VEG6gxFIMfl4Cdog26avS,Waltz for Debby (Take 2),49H4LDNFE5BU7ZMIg8UsZy, In her own sweet world Populated by dolls and clowns And a prince and a big purple bear Lives my favorite girl Unaware of the worried frowns That we weary grown ups all wear In the sun she dances to silent music Songs that are spun of gold Somewhere in her own little head One day all too soon She ll grow up and she ll leave her dolls And her prince and her silly old bear When she goes they will cry As she whispers Goodbye They will miss her I fear But then so will I
Bill Evans Trio,3VEG6gxFIMfl4Cdog26avS,Some Other Time,0oEIrVWpLj01XtFtDitQyR, Where has the time all gone to Have nt done half the things we want to Oh well we ll catch up some other time This day was just a token Too many words are still unspoken Oh well we ll catch up some other time Just when the fun is starting Comes the time for parting Let s just be glad for what we had And what s to come There s some much more embracing Still to be done but time is racing Oh well we ll catch up some other time
