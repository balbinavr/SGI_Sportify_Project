Jason Mraz,4phGZZrJZRo4ElhRtViYdl,Unlonely,7Igc6JB0xPDcn5yRkkVGQX, It could be love And we could be homies And once you get to know me I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Oh we could take it slowly And we could keep it low key I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely I ve been chasing summer around Searching for the sunshine looking for a good time Following the good vibes Listening to intuition when it s happening Diggin into life cause at times it can be saddening Yeah it could be a grey day If you re lonely A little rain suddenly turns heavy But a whole lot of love can make the clouds go away Maybe the time for us is now When the table s set for two And there s nobody with you Seeing movies by yourself Let me be your someone else It could be love And we could be homies And once you get to know me I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Oh we could take it slowly And we could keep it low key I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Love lalalala love Love lala love One and only I could make you unlonely I give you my work although I m making words up Unlonely ai nt a word but I do nt give a fuck Cause I m fresh form the farm where critics ca nt bother me Living is tricky as it is so that ai nt stoppin me You and me we both agree That no one needs the scrutiny All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me With your beautiful smile and your style continuity I d be a fool not to take the opportunity to say Hey We should be homies I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie Oh maybe just be ourselves never phony Never second guessing the friendship connection Parallel living never in possession Of your individual personal expression Together we re just a much better reflection of Love We could be homies And once you get to know me I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Oh we could take it slowly And we could keep it low key I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Love lalalala love Love lala love One and only I could make you unlonely Love lalalala love Love lala love One and only I could make you unlonely When the table s set for two And there s nobody with you Seeing movies by yourself Let me be your someone else If you re spending time alone If it s just you and your phone Taking pictures of yourself Baby maybe I can help It could be love We could be homies And once you get to know me I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Oh we could take it slowly And we could keep it low key I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely Love lalalala love Love lala love One and only I could make you unlonely It could be love We could be homies Love lalalala love And once you get to know me Love lala love I could be your one and only I could make you unlonely
