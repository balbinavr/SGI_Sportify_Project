Tom Petty,2UZMlIwnkgAEDBsw1Rejkn,Wildflowers,2Pr1nZpt8A8WP7QYpyq6L3, You belong among the wildflowers You belong in a boat out at sea Sail away kill off the hours You belong somewhere you feel free Run away find you a lover Go away somewhere all bright and new I have seen no other Who compares with you You belong among the wildflowers You belong in a boat out at sea You belong with your love on your arm You belong somewhere you feel free Run away go find a lover Run away let your heart be your guide You deserve the deepest of cover You belong in that home by and by You belong among the wildflowers You belong somewhere close to me Far away from your trouble and worry You belong somewhere you feel free You belong somewhere you feel free
Tom Petty,2UZMlIwnkgAEDBsw1Rejkn,You Don't Know How It Feels,7MooGz4ZPE4bNxjFegR6Jx, Let me run with you tonight I ll take you on a moonlight ride There s someone I used to see But she do nt give a damn for me But let me get to the point Let s roll another joint And turn the radio loud I m too alone to be proud You do nt know how it feels You do nt know how it feels To be me People come people go Some grow young some grow cold I woke up in between A memory and a dream So let s get to the point Let s roll another joint And let s head on down the road There s somewhere I got ta go You do nt know how it feels You do nt know how it feels To be me My old man was born to rock He s still trying to beat the clock Think of me what you will I ve got a little space to fill So let s get to the point Let s roll another joint And let s head on down the road There s somewhere I got ta go And you do nt know how it feels You do nt know how it feels No you do nt know how it feels To be me You do nt know how it feels You do nt know how it feels No you do nt know how it feels To be me
Tom Petty,2UZMlIwnkgAEDBsw1Rejkn,Time To Move On,20dt11ZTAtjsfcNJLP9u30, It s time to move on it s time to get going What lies ahead I have no way of knowing But under my feet baby grass is growing It s time to move on time to get going Broken skyline Movin through the airport She s an honest defector Conscientious objector Now her own protector A broken skyline Which way to love land Which way to something better Which way to forgiveness Which way do I go Yeah it s time to move on time to get going What lies ahead I have no way of knowing But under my feet baby grass is growing It s time to move on time to get going Sometime later Getting the words wrong Wasting the meaning And losing the rhyme Nauseous adrenalin Like breakin up a dogfight Like a deer in the headlights Frozen in real time I m losing my mind Yeah it s time to move on time to get going What lies ahead I have no way of knowing But under my feet baby grass is growing It s time to move on it s time to get going Yeah it s time to move on time to get going What lies ahead I have no way of knowing But under my feet baby grass is growing It s time to move on it s time to get going Yeah it s time to move on it s time to get going
Tom Petty,2UZMlIwnkgAEDBsw1Rejkn,It's Good To Be King,1c0flvMImhKMuiZIc0VzEb, It s good to be king if just for a while To be there in velvet yeah to give em a smile It s good to get high and never come down It s good to be king of your own little town Yeah the world would swing if I were king Can I help it if I still dream time to time It s good to be king and have your own way Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings You re out there with winners yeah it s good to be king Yeah I ll be king when dogs get wings Can I help it if I still dream time to time It s good to be king and have your own world It helps to make friends it s good to meet girls A sweet little queen who ca nt run away It s good to be king whatever it pays Excuse me if I have some place in my mind Where I go time to time
