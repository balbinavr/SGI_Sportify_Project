Melody Gardot,2P1puQXmG48EVLBrHbum1J,Baby I'm A Fool,3XZN4wXwG2o0OadHWExzPr, How was I to know that this was always Only just a little game to you All the time I thought you gave your heart I thought that I would do the same for you Tell the truth I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away When the words you say are Baby I m a fool who thinks it s cool to fall in love If I gave a thought to fascination I would know it was nt right to care Logic does nt seem to mind That I am fascinated by a love affair Still my heart would benefit From a little tenderness from time to time But never mind Cause baby I m a fool who thinks it s cool to fall in love Maybe I should hold on just a moment And be sure it s not for vanity Look me in the eye and tell me Love is never based upon insanity Hear the way my heart is beating Hurry up the moment s fleeting Kiss me now do nt ask me how Cause baby I m a fool who thinks it s cool to fall Baby I m a fool who thinks it s cool to fall And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in love
