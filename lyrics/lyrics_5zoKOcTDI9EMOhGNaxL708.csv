Gov't Mule,5zoKOcTDI9EMOhGNaxL708,Soulshine,1oHdIbwsw3jJvrIKvZdB2e, Soulshine When you ca nt find the light That guides you through a cloudy day When the stars ai nt shinin bright And you feel like you ve lost you re way When the candle lights of home Burn so very far away Well you got to let your soul shine Just like my daddy used to say He used to say soul shine It s better than sunshine It s better than moonshine Damn sure better than rain Well now people do nt mind We all get this way sometimes Got to let your soul shine Shine till the break of day I grew up thinkin that I had it made Gon na make it on my own But life can take the strongest man And make him feel so alone Now sometimes I feel a cold wind Blowin through my achin bones I think back to what my daddy said He said Boy in the darkness before the dawn Let your soul shine It s better than sunshine It s better than moonshine Damn sure better than rain Yeah now people do nt mind We all get this way sometimes Got to let your soul shine Shine till the break of day Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul A woman too God knows you feel like this yes you can And when your world seems cold You got to let your spirit take control Let your soul shine It s better than sunshine It s better than moonshine Damn sure better than rain Lord now people do nt mind We all get this way sometimes Got to let your soul shine Yeah shine on and on and on Oh it s better than sunshine It s better than moonshine Damn sure better than rain Yeah now people do nt mind We all get this way sometimes Got to let your soul shine Yeah shine on and on and on Shine till the break of day
Gov't Mule,5zoKOcTDI9EMOhGNaxL708,Banks Of The Deep End,3arCQT1KEJ510VVh5BLEwM, On the banks of the deep end Where your soul is your best friend Searching for a reason To go astray Wild dreams turn to nightmares Silver clouds turn to golden stairs And everything that you used to know Is slipping away Here I ve got my puzzlepiece Only got it for a short term lease No time for asking No going back to get hurt I take a little from the mixture Try to fit it into the picture Got a place where you re standing Dig your shoes into the dirt Trying hard to get back Runnin on the stones Put you on my shoulders We can be the only one See the world s still spinning round Gettin dizzy when we look There s a reason to be home There s a feeling when you smile But it feels like it might take over This feeling deep inside And there s a distance down the line Far away from the station We can leave it all behind On a rolling creation Sit away from the window And lock the door Ca nt you learn from the last time And the time before See the world s still spinning round Gettin dizzy when we look Got to leave town To see the yellow flowers bloom Sun going down It s gon na be rising soon On the banks of the deep end Twisted as a riverbend Searching for a reason to go astray You could nt hire twentyfive men To do what the man could do Just the sound of his walking Could split the whole damn town in two Into the night full of shadows He still walks when the thunder rolls This river ai nt shallow Reminds us that the bell still tolls Bears in the kitchen Tigers on TV The singer s pretending That this song s for me See the world s still spinning round Gettin dizzy when we look You took a wrong turn Down by the waterline I heard they had to drag you off the sand Find a dune and the wind will miss you Hold on to a piece of dry land Got to hold on to a piece of dry land Got to hold on to a piece of dry land On the banks of the deep end Where I lost my best friend Searching for a reason to go astray

Gov't Mule,5zoKOcTDI9EMOhGNaxL708,Beautifully Broken,0w2om2rMLtfoWWLKEs0lDJ, Mysterious blown in with the night All this beauty captured in a frame Visibly shaken but never stirred drives them insane I see the way she plays her men and I know I ve got to know her name She s so beautifully broken shaped by the wind Dangerously twisted Here I go again I see the way she casts her spell It s like drowning in moonlight Discards them when she s done they re lost in her twilight I watch her move from star to star and I wonder why Why it feels so right She s so beautifully broken you can hardly see the flaw Especially from a distance which is always how I fall Why do I fall for the dangerous ones the ones that never learned to let go And why do I lie to myself and pretend that I can break her When she s already been so beautifully broken Why do I fall for the dangerous ones the ones that Do nt know how to let go And why do I lie to myself and pretend that I can break her When she s already been so beautifully broken She s so beautifully broken shaped by the wind Dangerously twisted Here I go again Here I go again
Gov't Mule,5zoKOcTDI9EMOhGNaxL708,Endless Parade,77gT9LvH23I5rYaPgyF8eg, A primadonna with a premonition feels like he s preachin to the choir A superstar filled with superstition ca nt pull himself out of the mire All you ever dreamed of is finally in your reach but careful what you wish for If you do nt practice what you preach The circus came to town I guess it must have stayed It s like an endless parade All these people you can see through like ghosts maybe you ve seen too much Nothing s real nothing you can feel no one you can touch Strangers stare in silence they think they know your mind No place to jump off that s the way the game s designed Another new day dawns another sunset fades It s like an endless parade Music music and more music imploding inside your brain The life that you have chosen did it finally drive you insane Psychophantic tirades fill your head with ammunition Sights set on your enemies but you keep losing your position Reluctantly you face the day try to get your gameface on What used to be a fantasy has now become a marathon Every heart you ever broke all the people you ve betrayed Another new day dawns Another sunset fades Yeh the circus came to town I guess it must have stayed It s like an endless parade
