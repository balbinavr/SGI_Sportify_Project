J. Cole,6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5,No Role Modelz,62vpWI1CHwFy7tMIcSStl8, First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil For real you the only father that I ever knew I get my bitch pregnant Ima be a better you Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville Fulfilled Listen even back when we was broke my team ill Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville Talk to a nigga One time for my LA sisters One time for my LA hoes Lame niggas ca nt tell the difference One time for a nigga who know Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved No role models and I m here right now No role models to speak of Searchin through my memory my memory I could nt find one Last night I was gettin my feet rubbed By the baddest bitch not Trina but I swear to God This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her Hey what s good Sorry I m never comin home Ima stay for good Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood I came fast like 911 in white neighborhoods Ai nt got no shame bout it She think I m spoiled and I m rich cause I can have any bitch I got defensive and said Nah I was the same without it But then I thought back back to a better me Before I was a Blist celebrity Before I started callin bitches bitches so heavily Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody You was nt sweatin me One time for my LA sisters One time for my LA hoes Lame niggas ca nt tell the difference One time for a nigga who know Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved I want a real love dark skinned and Aunt Viv love That Jada and that Will love That leave a toothbrush at your crib love And you ai nt got ta wonder whether that s your kid love Nigga I do nt want no bitch from reality shows Out of touch with reality hoes Out in Hollywood bringin back 5 or 6 hoes Fuck em then we kick em to the door Nigga you know how it go She deserved that she a bird it s a bird trap You think if I did nt rap she would flirt back Takin off her skirt let her wear my shirt before she leave Ima need my shirt back nigga you know how it go One time for my LA sisters One time for my LA hoes Lame niggas ca nt tell the difference One time for a nigga who know Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved There s an old saying in Tennessee I know it s in Texas probably in Tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you If you fool me we ca nt get fooled again Fool me one time shame on you Fool me twice ca nt put the blame on you Fool me three times fuck the peace signs Load the chopper let it rain on you Fool me one time shame on you Fool me twice ca nt put the blame on you Fool me three times fuck the peace signs Load the chopper let it rain on you My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet My only regret was too young for Nia Long Now all I m left with is hoes from reality shows Hand her a script the bitch probably could nt read along My only regret was too young for Sade Adu My only regret could never take Aaliyah home Now all I m left with is hoes up in Greystone With the stale face cause they know it s they song She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow One time for my LA sisters One time for my LA hoes Lame niggas ca nt tell the difference One time for a nigga who know Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved One time for my LA sisters One time for my LA hoes Lame niggas ca nt tell the difference One time for a nigga who know Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved Do nt save her She do nt wan na be saved
