Ella Fitzgerald,5V0MlUE1Bft0mbLlND7FJz,Frosty The Snowman,76nIlhb7sx9W9ceQKVKreg, Frosty the snowman Was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose And two eyes made out of coal Frosty the snowman Is a fairytale they say He was made of snow But the children know How he came to life one day There must have been some magic In that old silk hat they found For when they placed it on his head He began to dance around Frosty the snowman Was alive as he could be And the children say He could laugh and play Just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman Knew the sun was hot that day So he said let s run And we ll have some fun Now before I melt away Down to the village With a broomstick in his hand Running here and there all around the square Saying catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town Right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when He heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman Had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye Saying do nt you cry I ll be back again some day Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Look at frosty go Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Over the hills of snow
Ella Fitzgerald,5V0MlUE1Bft0mbLlND7FJz,Cheek To Cheek,1gcuhZPKmTYvn5VT5EZLR6, Heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Heaven I m in heaven And the cares that hung around me through the week Seem to vanish like a gambler s lucky streak When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to climb a mountain And to reach the highest peak But it does nt thrill me half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to go out fishing In a river or a creek But I do nt enjoy it half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Dance with me I want my arm about you That charm about you Will carry me through To heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek

Ella Fitzgerald,5V0MlUE1Bft0mbLlND7FJz,Smooth Sailing,5p05OluBU1hCk1DDLMnixl, We did nt break apart in stormy weather We did nt run around like others do Now we re not afraid when storm clouds gather Cause we got the kind of love that ll see us through We ve got smooth sailing sailing Looks like every drop of rain is gone gone gone Smooth sailing sailing And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on We find each others arms in troubled waters We found that s the safest place to go From now we can laugh at troubled waters Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow We ve got smooth sailing sailing Looks like every drop of rain is gone gone gone Smooth sailing sailing And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on We ve got smooth sailing sailing Looks like every drop of rain is gone gone gone Smooth sailing sailing And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on
