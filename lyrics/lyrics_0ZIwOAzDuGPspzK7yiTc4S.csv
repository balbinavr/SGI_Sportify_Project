Little Feat,0ZIwOAzDuGPspzK7yiTc4S,Dixie Chicken,0eTHlx53lUn95HVsJtR6Qx, I ve seen the bright lights of Memphis And the Commodore Hotel And underneath a street lamp I met a southern belle Oh she took me to the river where she cast her spell And in that southern moonlight she sang this song so well If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb And we can walk together down in Dixieland Down in Dixieland We made all the hotspots my money flowed like wine Then the lowdown southern whiskey yeah began to fog my mind And I do nt remember church bells or the money I put down On the white picket fence and boardwalk On the house at the end of town Oh but boy do I remember the strain of her refrain And the nights we spent together And the way she called my name If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb And we can walk together down in Dixieland Down in Dixieland Many years since she ran away Yes that guitar player sure could play She always liked to sing along She always handy with a song But then one night at the lobby of the Commodore Hotel I chanced to meet a bartender who said he knew her well And as he handed me a drink he began to hum a song And all the boys there at the bar began to sing along If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb And we can walk together down in Dixieland Down in Dixieland Down in Dixieland
Little Feat,0ZIwOAzDuGPspzK7yiTc4S,Two Trains,4CwpuCZcK6Vym6BZd8Pgfe, In 1966 I found my love In 1967 I had all there was And as my time went by I was satisfied Until that situation took me by surprise Now there s two trains runnin on that line One train s me and the other s a friend of mine You know it would be all right be just fine If the woman took one train and left the other behind Illusion it is just the same conclusion I do nt know how to play the game Of what it is or how it s going to be When one train is my friend and the other train is me Easy I say easy I ca nt push or shove her So I guess I really care Now I m not one to hide my love behind a lock and key But if things keep going the way they are there s no place left for me There s two trains runnin on that line One train s me and the other s a friend of mine You know it would be all right be just fine If the woman took one train and left the other behind Two trains two trains two trains two trains
