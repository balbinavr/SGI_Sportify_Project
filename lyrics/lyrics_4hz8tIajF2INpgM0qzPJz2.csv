Rainbow Kitten Surprise,4hz8tIajF2INpgM0qzPJz2,Devil Like Me,0HsGh7cboYz6cVMIyFrQ8j, My heart and soul were never mine to own What you care to die for What you care to die for We die alone we ll all die young What you care to die for What you care to die for Snow snow glistens on the mount whiskey on the ledge Shake it out and light a cigarette Miss me when you you wish you were nt right Shake me all out if I m wrong for you for you Shake it all out when I m gone I for you Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep while the earth turns And his kids learn to say fuck you They do nt love you Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams Where the earth burns She cries cause she s nothing like you is she like you Whatch you want from a devil like me devil like me You see the devil do nt mean to be evil He just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation Holes riddled in your head little bit of lead Shake it out and line a silhouette Miss me when you you wish were nt kind of glad Shake me all out when you re done for you for you Shake it all out when I m gone I you Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep While the earth turns And his kids learn to say fuck you They do nt love you Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams Where the earth burns she cries Cause she s nothing like you is she like you What do you want from a devil like me Am I like you
