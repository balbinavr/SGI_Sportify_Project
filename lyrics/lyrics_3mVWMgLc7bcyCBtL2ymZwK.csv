The Arcs,3mVWMgLc7bcyCBtL2ymZwK,Lake Superior,1s5wRbjKYS4PwvRiUDGtVt, On a stretch of sand sweet northern breeze Manitowoc put Avery on the beach Your alibi will never do When the whole town s got it out for you Judge fox the Great Lake stain Got Superior wanting to pull its own drain To abandon the shore where the poor get whipped And the fat get fatter and the rich stay rich Where the mice of men are chained and bruised Where to stand accused is to admit you lose I wan na know people outdoor Ai nt gon na go out and act insane Insane My baby girl out in a world All alone burns a hole in my brain My brain I wan na know people outdoor Ai nt gon na go out and act insane Insane My baby boy pride and joy He s gon na go out and do the same Just saying In the hall of harm disgraceful sounds Manitowoc knows how to gavel pound They crack it right and shoot on site Do you know where your baby is tonite The red tide is back again Old Superior s new McCarthy clan Back on the shore where the poor get whipped And the fat get fatter and the rich stay rich Where the mice of men are chained and bruised Where to stand accused is to admit you lose I wan na know people outdoor Ai nt gon na go out and act insane Insane My baby girl out in a world All alone burns a hole in my brain My brain I wan na know people outdoor Ai nt gon na go out and act insane Insane My baby boy pride and joy He s gon na go out and do the same Just saying

The Arcs,3mVWMgLc7bcyCBtL2ymZwK,Searching the Blue,39ZADZC75ImPizqOfANjX3, War is over now I feel my mind returning Carried on a cloud Every nerve was burning over you I never had a need at all for anyone Anyone other than you But now that s through So through We re prayin to get it fast And we pray it s in the past Is anything we do ever gon na last Could nt I have a clue Searching the blue Could nt I have a clue Searching the blue Searching the blue The lay of land disease I ca nt handle even The right that we receive Have clouded beyond reason Still with me Human knows its self throughout without a doubt For better for worse we will remain The same We re praying to get it fast And we pray it s in the past Is anything we do ever gon na last Could nt I have a clue Searching the blue Could nt I have a clue Searching the blue Searching the blue

The Arcs,3mVWMgLc7bcyCBtL2ymZwK,Outta My Mind,4cgDk0IjwdG8w1ArIaqdpq, Good morning children Welcome to school I heard I lost my self control But everything I did just went and turned to gold I love the pictures on the wall Reminding me of what I lost to get it all Outta my mind but I made it Outta my mind I m faded Outta my mind The ones I love have left my side Outta my mind but I made it yeah I m old enough to know the game But pushing buttons now is all that keeps me sane What about tomorrow night Maybe we can take too much and start a fight Outta my mind but I made it Outta my mind I m faded Outta my mind The ones I love have left my side Outta my mind but I made it yeah Somebody help me now Because I ll come around If you do nt I ll sit down Outta my mind but I made it Outta my mind I m faded Outta my mind The ones I love have left my side Outta my mind but I made it yeah

The Arcs,3mVWMgLc7bcyCBtL2ymZwK,Tomato Can,4kQQHnmIzEyQi64G96dKZb, Did anybody hear The kid from Bakersfield They told him when to fall And how to fake and roll But the kid could really fight it was nt right Did anybody see A crowd of savage men Try to make a fool of him And pay him not to win His heart was in the ring He d fight most anything Lose it all just to win it back again Tomato Can They hold him in their hands And cheer him from the stands He fights for all the folks Who live against the ropes The need for him to bleed for them is real Did anybody see A crowd of savage men Try to make a fool of him And pay him not to win His heart was in the ring He d fight most anything Lose it all just to win it back again Tomato Can Did anybody hear The kid from Bakersfield He laid down in the ring All the lights went dim The need for him to bleed for them was true Did anybody see A crowd of savage men Try to make a fool of him And pay him not to win His heart was in the ring He d fight most anything Lose it all just to win it back again Lose it all just to win it back again Tomato Can
The Arcs,3mVWMgLc7bcyCBtL2ymZwK,Fools Gold,7bLxq42CmLv9Mn4SJqMYNy, Oh no You went and did it all again It s like you ve never heard a record spin But you got your style And that really cool smile Every fools golden child But you re so pale And so stale Everything you do is for sale So why should we care Singing why should we care Here you go again Another calculated move Before the needle ever hit the groove I know you make your dough But all the kids in the neighborhood know You do nt do like you done before You re so pale And so stale Everything you do is for sale Why should we care Singing why should we care It s the end of the line You re wasting my time Committing a crime Singing why should we care Oh why should we care It s the end of the line You re wasting my time Committing a crime It s time to press rewind
