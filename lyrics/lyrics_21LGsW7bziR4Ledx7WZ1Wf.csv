Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,Chances Are,6sAcECONsANle5n0rnP2at, Chances are cause I wear a silly grin The moment you come into view Chances are you think that I m in love with you Just because my composure sort of slips The moment that your lips meet mine Chances are you think my heart s your valentine In the magic of moonlight When I sigh Hold me close dear Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies Are in my eyes Guess you feel you ll always be The one and only one for me And if you think you could Well chances are your chances are awfully good Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies Are in my eyes Guess you feel you ll always be The one and only one for me And if you think you could Well chances are your chances are awfully good The chances are your chances are awfully good
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,It's Not For Me To Say,4lFXv6eBek6kEiGYzh2mH2, It s not for me to say you love me It s not for me to say you ll always care Oh but here for the moment I can hold you fast And press your lips to mine And dream that love will last As far as I can see This is heaven And speaking just for me It s ours to share Perhaps the glow of love will grow With every passing day Or we may never meet again But then it s not for me to say And speaking just for me It s ours to share Perhaps the glow of love will grow With every passing day Or we may never meet again But then it s not for me to say
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,Misty,4uxsv9PjV3Yeyn51RdWvGJ, Look at me I m as helpless as a kitten up a tree And I feel like I m clinging to a cloud I ca nt understand I get misty just holding your hand Walk my way And a thousand violins begin to play Or it might be the sound of your hello That music I hear I get misty the moment you re near You can say that you re leading me on But it s just what I want you to do Do nt you notice how hoplessly I m lost That s why I m following you On my own Would I wander through this wonderland alone Never knowing my right foot from my left My hat from my glove I m too misty and too much in love Repeat after music interlude Look at me
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,We Need a Little Christmas,1XXDZwNnzTZkZkutC2Vmfr, Haul out the holly Put up the tree before my spirit falls again Fill up the stocking I may be rushing things but deck the halls again now For we need a little Christmas right this very minute Candles in the window carols at the spinet Yes we need a little Christmas right this very minute Has nt snowed a single flurry but Santa dear we re in a hurry Climb down the chimney Turn on the brightest string of lights I ve ever seen Slice up the fruit cake It s time we ve hung some tinsel on the evergreen bough For I ve grown a little leaner grown a little colder Grown a little sadder grown a little older And I need a little angel sitting on my shoulder Need a little Christmas now For we need a little music need a little laughter Need a little singing ringing through the rafter And we need a little snappy happy ever after We need a little Christmas now
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,Silver Bells,00IqwkT0PZhJ86PJajRCqk, Christmas makes you feel emotional It may bring parties or thoughts devotional Whatever happens or what may be Here is what Christmas time means to me City sidewalk busy sidewalks Dressed in holiday style In the air theres A feeling of Christmas Children laughing people passing Meeting smile after smile And on every street corner you ll hear Silver bells silver bells It s Christmas time in the city Ringaling hear them ring Soon it will be Christmas day City street lights Even stop lights Blink a bright red and green As the shoppers rush home With their treasures Hear the snow crunch See the kids bunch This is Santa s big scene And above all this bustle you ll hear Silver bells silver bells It s Christmas time in the city Ringaling hear them ring Soon it will be Christmas day
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,When a Child Is Born,5KH8Bn8PLlJK1tgylE3oK9, A ray of hope flickers in the sky A tiny star lights up way up high All across the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born A silent wish sails the seven seas The winds of change whisper in the trees And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn This comes to pass when a child is born A rosy hue settles all around You ve got the feel you re on solid ground For a spell or two noone seems forlorn This comes to pass when a child is born And all of this happens because the world is waiting Waiting for one child Black white yellow noone knows But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter Hate to love war to peace and everyone to everyone s neighbour And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever It s all a dream an illusion now It must come true sometime soon somehow All across the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born
Johnny Mathis,21LGsW7bziR4Ledx7WZ1Wf,Winter Wonderland,1JtYy7MFUIZM0MREJaZhTP, Sleigh bells ring are you listnin In the lane snow is glistnin A beautiful sight we re happy tonight Walkin in the winter wonderland Gone away is the blue bird Here to stay is a new bird He sings a love song as we go along Walkin in the winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is Parson Brown He ll say are you married We ll say no man But you can do the job when you re in town Later on we ll conspire as we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that we ve made Walkin in the winter wonderland Over the ground lies a mantle of white A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night Two hearts are thrillin In spite of the chill in the weather Love knows no season love knows no clime Romance can blossom any old time Here in the open We re walkin and hopin together Together together together Sleigh bells ring are you listnin In the lane snow is glistnin A beautiful sight we re happy tonight Walkin in the winter wonderland Gone away is the blue bird Here to stay is a new bird He s singing love song as we go along Walkin in the winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he s a circus clown We ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman Until the other kiddies knock him down When it snows ai nt it thrillin Tho your nose gets a chillin We ll frolic and play the eskimo way Walkin in the winter wonderland Walkin in the winter wonderland Winter wonder winter wonderland Winter winter wonder wonderland
