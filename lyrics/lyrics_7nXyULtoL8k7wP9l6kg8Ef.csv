Madeleine Peyroux,7nXyULtoL8k7wP9l6kg8Ef,On My Own,1KF5UnhkZND68DKHSQzu0A, Come to the day is new hit the floor Crack the door and what do I see Strange kid standing there Who is that in the mirror Could it be me Someone opens the bedroom door Somebody wanders the hall Someone s crossin my kitchen floor Was nt there somebody I loved Who lived here before Ah What am I missing here Ah Something has disappeared Cause I m all alone like a leaf That s blown into the great unknown On my own Stumbling down the stairs Run my hands through my hair What did I say that night Old friend were nt you with me Then promising to hold me tight Outside where the day is bright But nothing is real I wander the city streets trying to remind myself How it felt to feel Ah What am I missing here Ah something has disappeared Cause I m all alone like a pebble thrown Into the great unknown On my own Maybe I ll change my style Try to be nice for a while Paint on a sincere smile Get in touch with my inner child Ah Something is missing here Ah Something has disappeared Cause I m all alone like a bird That s flown into the great unknown On my own

Madeleine Peyroux,7nXyULtoL8k7wP9l6kg8Ef,To Love You All Over Again,4EPwpBN0t11bIxjsAI8oaF, A quiet room is what you get An empty glass an unmade bed A picture window with a view And all I think about is you To feel so bad to feel so good To let it be misunderstood Now I long to lose my senses And love you all over again The shouted words the tired sighs The traded kiss of sad goodbyes The living off of our desires Then putting out a thousand fires To feel so bad to feel so good To let it be misunderstood Now I d tear down my defenses To love you all over again To know a place without regret You make believe you paid your debt But in that clean and quiet room You ca nt believe it s over yet Out on a lark at home asleep The endings play the bands retreat But in that dumb luck of the few The consolation comes to you To feel so bad to feel so good The verdict s in it s understood I will be tried for my offenses And love you all over again Out on a spree at home asleep The endings play the bands retreat But in that dumb luck of the few The consolation comes to you To feel so bad to feel so good The verdict s in it s understood That I d be tried for my offenses And love you all over again
