Green Day,7oPftvlwr6VrsViSDV7fJY,Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),6ORqU0bHbVCRjXm9AjyHyZ, Another turning point a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go So make the best of this test and do nt ask why It s not a question but a lesson learned in time It s something unpredictable but in the end it s right I hope you had the time of your life So take the photographs and stillframes in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it s worth it was worth all the while It s something unpredictable but in the end it s right I hope you had the time of your life It s something unpredictable but in the end it s right I hope you had the time of your life It s something unpredictable but in the end it s right I hope you had the time of your life
Green Day,7oPftvlwr6VrsViSDV7fJY,21 Guns,64yrDBpcdwEdNY9loyEGbX, Do you know what s worth fighting for When it s not worth dying for Does it take your breath away And you feel yourself suffocating Does the pain weigh out the pride And you look for a place to hide Did someone break your heart inside You re in ruins One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I When you re at the end of the road And you ve lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn t pass Nothing s ever built to last You re in ruins One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home Did you stand too close to the fire Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone When it s time to live and let die And you ca nt get another try Something inside this heart has died You re in ruins One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I
