when it was me and you baby Yeah used to dream about the coupe baby Now I think of me and you Cunning linguistics Punishing puns Pumping the petro gas in my lungs Loving the low times higher than a mug Up in the cabinet Imagine a baby reaching his hands up to grab it A pipe done busted in heaven And got to leaking out blessings Reaching my hands up to grab it Rein my bands up Uh uh Sunny metropolis overzealous as telefone Telefone a new continent maybe rode me a rocketship Copper all on my dash and he ticket that lady optimist Said I m moving too fast slow down slow down Opened up for Lauryn Hill woah now woah now Woah now Everything is everything and the object steady mystified My allegories underneath the rock will only fear resides I bet I m gon find it I know I m gon find it Happiness bank account white accountant I found the fountain I was born in all black how could God denounce this I told Him Give me my money I need my money now Thank you Jesus whoever you are I know you gifted me the gift of gab and simile And simpleness the solitude is loneliness Been good to me I told them Give me my happy I need my holy now Thank you Jesus whoever you are Thank you Jesus whoever you are
