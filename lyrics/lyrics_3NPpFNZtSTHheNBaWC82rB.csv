X Ambassadors,3NPpFNZtSTHheNBaWC82rB,"Home (with Machine Gun Kelly, X Ambassadors & Bebe Rexha)",0OI7AFifLSoGzpb8bdBLLV, Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Someone take me Look I did nt power through the struggle Just to let a little trouble knock me out of my position And interrupt the vision After everything I witnessed after all of these decisions All these miles feet inches They ca nt add up to the distance That I have been through just to get to A place where even if there s no closure I m still safe I still ache from trying to keep pace Somebody give me a sign I m starting to lose faith Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares How did I lose it when I was right there Now I m so far that it feels like it s all gone to pieces Tell me why the world never fights fair I m trying to find Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home It s been a long time coming Someone take me Home hoooome Home home Someone take me Home hoooome Home home Look I ve been through so much pain And it s hard to maintain any smile on my face Cause there s madness on my brain So I got ta make it back but my home ai nt on the map Got ta follow what I m feeling to discover where it s at I need the memory In case this fate is forever just to be sure these last days are better And if I have any enemies To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares How did I lose it when I was right there Now I m so far that it feels like it s all gone to pieces Tell me why the world never fights fair I m trying to find Home A place where I can go To take this off my shoulders Someone take me home Someone take me I found no cure for the loneliness I found no cure for the sickness Nothing here feels like home Crowded streets but I m all alone I found no cure for the loneliness I found no cure for the sickness Nothing here feels like home Crowded streets but I m all alone Someone take me Home hoooome Take me home Home home take me home Someone take me Home hoooome someone someone Nothing here feels like home Home home Someone take me
