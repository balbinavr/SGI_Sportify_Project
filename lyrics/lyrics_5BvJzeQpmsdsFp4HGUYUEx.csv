Vampire Weekend,5BvJzeQpmsdsFp4HGUYUEx,Step,78J9MBkAoqfvyeEpQKJDzD, Everytime I see you in the world You always step to my girl Back back way back I used to front like Angkor Wat Mechanicsburg Anchorage and Dar es Salaam While home in New York was champagne and disco Tapes from LASan Francisco But actually Oakland and not Alameda Your girl was in Berkeley with her communist reader Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman I was a hoarder but girl that was back then The gloves are off the wisdom teeth are out What you on about I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I m stronger now I m ready for the house Such a modest mouse I ca nt do it alone I ca nt do it alone Everytime I see you in the world You always step to my girl Ancestors told me that their girl was better She s richer than Croesus she s tougher than leather I just ignored all the tales of a past life Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife And punks who would laugh when they saw us together Well they did nt know how to dress for the weather I can still see them there huddled on Astor Snow falling slow to the sound of the Master The gloves are off the wisdom teeth are out What you on about I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I m stronger now I m ready for the house Such a modest mouse I ca nt do it alone I ca nt do it alone Wisdom s a gift but you d trade it for youth Age is an honor it s still not the truth We saw the stars when they hid from the world You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl Maybe she s gone and I ca nt resurrect her The truth is she does nt need me to protect her We know the true death the true way of all flesh Everyone s dying but girl you re not old yet The gloves are off the wisdom teeth are out What you on about I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I m stronger now I m ready for the house Such a modest mouse I ca nt do it alone I ca nt do it alone The gloves are off the wisdom teeth are out What you on about I feel it in my bones I feel it in my bones I m stronger now I m ready for the house Such a modest mouse I ca nt do it alone I ca nt do it alone Everytime I see you in the world You always step to my girl
