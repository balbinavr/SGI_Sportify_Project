Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,Autumn Leaves,1QlTNF43OyKK9BorIRsJ8o, The falling leaves drift by the window The autumn leaves of red and gold I see your lips the summer kisses The sunburned hands I used to hold Since you went away the days grow long And soon I ll hear old winter s song But I miss you most of all my darling When autumn leaves start to fall Cest une chanson qui nous ressemble Toi tu maimais et je taimais Nous vivions tous deux ensemble Toi qui maimais moi qui taimais Mais la vie separe ceux qui saiment Tout doucement sans faire de bruit Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis
Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,My Funny Valentine,4l9hml2UCnxoNI3yCdL1BW, My funny valentine Sweet comic valentine You make me smile with my heart Your looks are laughable Unphotographable Yet you re my favorite work of art Is your figure less than Greek Is your mouth a little weak When you open it to speak Are you smart But do nt change a hair for me Not if you care for me Stay little valentine stay Each day is Valentine s Day
Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes),4gFlHAye7To29Fs4UszQUH, I get along without you very well Of course I do Except when soft rains fall And drip from leaves that I recall The thrill of being sheltered in your arms Of course I do But I get along without you very well I ve forgotten you just like I should Of course I have Except to hear your name Or someone s laugh that is the same But I ve forgotten you just like I should What a guy What a fool am I To think my breaking heart could kid the moon What s in store Should I fall once more No its best that I stick to my tune I get along without you very well Of course I do Except perhaps in spring But I should never think of spring For that would surely break my heart in two
Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,That Old Feeling,2d64G7VaZdHQuAquz5HQNu, I saw you last night and got that old feeling When you came in sight I got that old feeling The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill And when you caught my eye my heart stood still Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning Then I knew the spark of love was still burning There ll be no new romance for me it s foolish to start Cause that old feeling is still in my heart There ll be no new romance for me it s foolish to start Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,If You Could See Me Now,0GExhcihMVjrKsad725W62, If you could see me now you d know how blue I ve been One look is all you d need to see the mood I m in Perhaps then you d realize I m still in love with you If you could see me now you d find me being brave And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave But that s quite impossible I m still in love with you You ll happen my way on some memrable day And the month will be May for a while I ll try to smile but can I play the part Without my heart behind the smile The way I feel for you I never could disguise The look of love is written plainly in my eyes I think you d be mine again if you could see me now
Chet Baker,3rxeQlsv0Sc2nyYaZ5W71T,Let's Get Lost,6EZXO2zjC6KlLbNwc2HDMc, Let s get lost lost in each other s arms Let s get lost let them send out alarms And though they ll think us rather rude Let s tell the world we re in that crazy mood Let s defrost in a romantic mist Let s get crossed off everybody s list To celebrate this night we found each other mmm let s get lost Let s defrost in a romantic mist Let s get crossed off everybody s list To celebrate this night we found each other mm let s get lost Oh oh let s get lost
