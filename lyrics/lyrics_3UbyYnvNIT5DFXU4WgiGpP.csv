Whitesnake,3UbyYnvNIT5DFXU4WgiGpP,Here I Go Again,29pzjF6ZkzcW3ofgOVbF0t, I do nt know where I m going But I sure know where I ve been Hanging on the promises in the songs of yesterday And I ve made up my mind I ai nt wasting no more time Here I go again Here I go again Though I keep searching for an answer I never seem to find what I m looking for Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on Cause I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams Here I go again on my own Goin down the only road I ve ever known Like a drifter I was born to walk alone And I ve made up my mind I ai nt wasting no more time I m just another heart in need of rescue Waiting on love s sweet charity And I m gon na hold on for the rest of my days Cause I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams And here I go again on my own Goin down the only road I ve ever known Like a drifter I was born to walk alone And I ve made up my mind I ai nt wasting no more time But here I go again Here I go again Here I go again Here I go Cause I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams And here I go again on my own Goin down the only road I ve ever known Like a drifter I was born to walk alone And I ve made up my mind I ai nt wasting no more time And here I go again on my own Goin down the only road I ve ever known Like a drifter I was born to walk alone Cause I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams And here I go again on my own Goin down the only road I ve ever known Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
