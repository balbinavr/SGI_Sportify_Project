Jai Wolf,24V5UY0nChKpnb1TBPJhCw,Starlight,4Dnss7a0Fobyvw2aWBnDzm, Starlight raining over me Like drifting through a memory Wake up in your crystal sky We re floating just to feel alive Starlight raining over me Like drifting through a memory Wake up in your crystal sky We re floating till we fly We re slowly falling through the night Illuminating coastlines Headlights toward the afterlife Bright enough to shine Colors fade into the waves Swimming through reality I see your eyes above it all I can hear you call Starlight raining over me Like drifting through a memory Wake up in your crystal sky We re floating till we fly

Jai Wolf,24V5UY0nChKpnb1TBPJhCw,Lost (feat. Chelsea Jade),50pEs4BEQlgoZo6rKHNtEA, You re the mouth of the tunnel just before the dark I m the headlights speeding through the stars And we re lost in the spaces of who we are And we move through the nights till we take it too far Hold it together when we move apart Let the landscape burn like a dying art Driven by the energy in our hearts We were built to be reckless from the start And the light just flickers past our faces Living in a dream cause we re always wasted Never stay still when we re chasing places And the light just flickers past our faces Living at a dream cause we re always wasted Making up our minds that we re never changing Cause we re getting lost and found when we re carried away I feel it all around even in our mistakes And when we re up we re down in the evening space We re getting lost and found when we re carried away When we re carried away The truth gets tired when we lie awake So we dive into dreams that they ca nt sedate Breathe in and out to go all the way Trip till we re fixed in a higher state And the light just flickers past our faces Living in a dream cause we re always wasted Never stay still when we re chasing places And the light just flickers past our faces Living at a dream cause we re always wasted Making up our minds that we re never changing Cause we re getting lost and found when we re carried away I feel it all around even in our mistakes And when we re up we re down in the evening space We re getting lost and found when we re carried away Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me And the light just flickers past our faces We re living out a dream cause we re always wasted And the light just flickers past our faces We never stay still when we re chasing places Cause we re getting lost and found when we re carried away I feel it all around even in our mistakes And when we re up we re down in the evening space We re getting lost and found when we re carried away Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me Carry me

Jai Wolf,24V5UY0nChKpnb1TBPJhCw,Gravity (feat. JMR),1OBUY61V7sX1vcS99PxKLa, Tell me one good reason why I should try Continuing to fight it Running in circles round and round and round Hoping I ll defy it Tell me one good reason why I should try Thinking that I can hide it When all I do is push and pull full reverse Hoping it do nt hurt this time But how can I resist when a force like this pulls me under Why should I pretend that gravity will suddenly surrender It s just human nature It s just human nature It s just human nature Ca nt convince me that I m out of touch When I m the one that says too much though you do nt hear me We re tethered like magnets Like a kite to your wrist wo nt you pull me down here Then tell me one good reason why The reprieve for heart and mind is nt near us I hear your voice from the balcony Our song rushes back to me It s never been more clear But how can I resist when a force like this pulls me under Why should I pretend that gravity will suddenly surrender It s just human nature It s just human nature It s just human nature How can I resist when a force like this pulls me under Why should I pretend that gravity will send me surrender It s just human nature It s just human nature Tell me how can I resist It s just human nature It s just human nature Tell me how can I resist It s just human nature It s just human nature
