Eagles Of Death Metal,02uYdhMhCgdB49hZlYRm9o,Miss Alissa,1dlgaGdQXmsYKMRuewIZkF, You know I try so hard But I think you do nt see Cause I m moving so fast We call it rock n rollin My weapon seems usless Cause your on to me You are impossible to read You re always straight controllin Oh oh oh Miss Allisa Gon na do a voodoo dance until You feel my power now You know I feel so smooth I m always struttin when in motion Make the little girls dance Cause I m rock n rollin It reallly does nt matter If you re hard to please Cause when you give me your smile I m yours for straight controllin Repeat first verse and then chorus
