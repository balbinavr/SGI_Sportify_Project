Quinn XCII,3ApUX1o6oSz321MMECyIYd,Flare Guns,69B4b2ZLXZtADgzWk2RfpY, Focus on you in the light it helps me fill my emotions Why are we at such a distance Find ourselves so out of frame This love stays calm in the night yeah help me heal and reopen Why are we drifting away from everything we wanted to save I told you I d be down forever Loving you is danger but it do nt feel wrong It s old news I should look for better Falling back to strangers leave me hanging on Flare guns go off in my head saying not to call you this late Still I dial those numbers every time Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May Slowly wishing you were never mine Your face became all I know I d try to picture another Why are we frayed at the edge it s making me feel all to blame I wan na know what s the deal Where have you been and what do you think of me Is there a new girl silently screaming your name I told you I d be down forever Loving you is danger but it do nt feel wrong It s old news I should look for better Falling back to strangers leave me hanging on You leave me hanging on Flare guns go off in my head saying not to call you this late Still I dial those numbers every time Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May Slowly wishing you were never mine I told you I d be down forever Loving you is danger but it do nt feel wrong It s old news I should look for better Falling back to strangers leave me hanging on See I do nt know better than to give up on loving Why am I still holding on I m still holding on And I m way too honest and you make me want it Lying alone all night long alone all night long When flare guns go off in my head saying not to call you this late Still I dial those numbers every time Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May Slowly wishing you were never mine Flare guns go off in my head saying not to call you this late Still I dial those numbers every time Still I dial those numbers every time Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May Slowly wishing you were never mine Slowly wishing you were never mine
