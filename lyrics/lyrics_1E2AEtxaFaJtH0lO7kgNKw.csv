Russell Dickerson,1E2AEtxaFaJtH0lO7kgNKw,Yours,6RSNKGdv3nDTHqgw4bdzyF, I was a boat stuck in a bottle That never got the chance to touch the sea Just forgot on the shelf No wind in the sails Going no where with no one but me I was one in one in hundred billion A burned out star in a galaxy Just lost in the sky wondering why Everyone else shines out but me But I came to life when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I m yours I was a worn out set of shoes Wandering the city street Another face in the crowd Head looking down Lost in the sound of a lonely melody Empty pockets at a roulette Always landing on a lost bet Just live for the spin and hope for the win Go all in just to lose again But I came to life when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I m yours The worst me is just a long gone memory You put a new heartbeat inside of me You make me better than I was before Thank God I m yours I was a boat stuck in a bottle That never got the chance to touch the sea I came to life when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I m yours The worst me is just a long gone memory You put a new heartbeat inside of me You make me better than I was before Thank God I m yours Thank God I m yours Thank God I m yours Thank God I m yours
