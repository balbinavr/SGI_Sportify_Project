Chris Janson,60gmlHZmT16wiO9GiXKYK9,Drunk Girl,1kFBLqkTuNKlspkJ1EOGjN, Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows She s either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup Take a drunk girl home She s bouncing like a pinball Singing every word she never knew Dancing with her eyes closed like she s the only one in the room Her hair s a perfect mess falling out of that dress Take a drunk girl home Take a drunk girl home Let her sleep all alone Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone Pick up her life she threw on the floor Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door That s how she knows the difference between a boy and man Take a drunk girl home You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat They re singing Closing Time at that little bar across the street In two by twos strangers and lovers headed for the covers hooking up That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off And through the paperthin walls you can hear the neighbors cigarette cough There s a million things you could be doing but there s one thing you re damn sure glad you did Take a drunk girl home Let her sleep all alone Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone Pick up her life she threw on the floor Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door That s how ya know the difference between a boy and man You take a drunk girl home You took a drunk girl home In the sober light of dawn She left you a message she thanks you on the phone Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door That s how she knows the difference between a boy and man Take a drunk girl home You take a drunk girl home Take a drunk girl home
