Emma Zander),5m4DjkPaGvrcHGT5h8oNCM, Yeah house in the hills all white Kinda look like a Apple Store Sober but that s all right Kinda drunk from the night before Hopin I m not too high Full moon light but you cracked the door I do nt know much what the blinds are for Not another house round here for miles Cigarette to the lip look a little sad but she laughin a bit Tellin me she glad that she found me and shit That I hotline bling hit you back in a sec Look to the left gun by the bed Veer to the right pills and a pipe I do nt know much anymore but a blind silhouette and the howl of a wolf in the night Playing love songs how ironic Eyes roll back when she in the moment LA star life so iconic They do nt got ghosts but their houses haunted I think about takin her out A movie or maybe to dinner Then her phone rang and her mood changed Cause her man will be home any minute Everybody says you re no good Bella you the best I ever had Never wan na leave when I should You re no good but I like you bad Everybody says you re no good Bella you the best I ever had Never wan na leave when I should You re no good but I like you bad And when I wake up it s a quarter to seven She already up and she raidin the kitchen She offer me coffee I tell her No thank you She pour me a cup anyway but I m grateful Despite all the crazy she seem pretty cool Grew up in London but Cali for school Guess that explain why your accent is different and not really British but still in the pool wow If it is nt the same thing it s the same thing twice We ai nt sayin the same things that we did last night You were givin me goosebumps and the leg stretch Arms out with your fists clenched On the beach side got your thirst quenched Ah man damn now all I see is Pretty girl in a Holiday Inn Gram brag in a mansion or a hashtag in the Caribbean I think about takin her out A movie or maybe to dinner Then her phone rang and her mood changed Cause her man will be home any minute Everybody says you re no good Bella you the best I ever had Never wan na leave when I should You re no good but I like you bad Everybody says you re no good Bella you the best I ever had Never wan na leave when I should You re no good but I like you bad But I like you bad You re no good but I like you bad You re no good but I like you bad
