Brooks & Dunn,0XKOBt59crntr7HQXXO8Yz,Neon Moon,3EUl8M6SzxZl03NPkB8mUd, When the sun goes down On my side of town That lonesome feeling Comes to my door The whole world turns blue There s a rundown bar Cross the railroad tracks I ve got a table for two Way in the back Where I sit alone And think of losing you I spend most every night Beneath the light Of a neon moon If you lose your one and only There s always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon I think of two young lovers Running wild and free I close my eyes And sometimes see You in the shadows Of this smokefilled room No telling how many tears I ve sat here and cried Or how many lies That I ve lied Telling my poor heart She ll come back someday Oh but I ll be alright As long as there s light From a neon moon If you lose your one and only There s always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon The jukebox plays on Drink by drink And the words of every sad song Seem to say what I think And this hurt inside of me Ai nt never gon na end Oh but I ll be alright As long as there s light From a neon moon If you lose your one and only There s always room here for the lonely To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon To watch your broken dreams Dance in and out of the beams Of a neon moon
