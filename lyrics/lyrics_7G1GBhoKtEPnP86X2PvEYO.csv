Nina Simone,7G1GBhoKtEPnP86X2PvEYO,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,0D1ceuzO7Yd6wd4X3RobPN, Baby you understand me now If sometimes you see that I m mad Do nt you know no one alive can always be an angel When everything goes wrong you see some bad But I m just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord please do nt let me be misunderstood You know sometimes baby I m so carefree With a joy that s hard to hide And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry And then you re bound to see my other side But I m just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord please do nt let me be misunderstood If I seem edgy I want you to know I never mean to take it out on you But life has its problems and I get more than my share But that s one thing I never mean to do Cause I love you Oh baby I m just human Do nt you know I have faults like anyone Sometimes I find myself alone regretting Some little foolish thing some simple thing that I ve done Cause I m just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord please do nt let me be misunderstood Do nt let me be misunderstood I try so hard so please do nt let me be misunderstood
