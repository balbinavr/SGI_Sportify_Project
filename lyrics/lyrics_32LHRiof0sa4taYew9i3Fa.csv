Dinah Washington,32LHRiof0sa4taYew9i3Fa,Mad About The Boy,2sjLTDps0h5swbnDd5dLDh, I m mad about the boy I know it s stupid to be mad about the boy I m so ashamed of it but must admit the sleepless nights I ve had About the boy On the silverscreen He melts my foolish heart in every single scene Although I m quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad About the boy Lord knows I m not a fool girl I really should nt care Lord knows I m not a school girl In the flurry of her first affair Will it ever cloy This odd diversity of misery and joy I m feeling quite insane and young again And all because I m mad about the boy So if I could employ A little magic that will finally destroy This dream that pains me and enchains me But I ca nt because I m mad I m mad about the boy
Dinah Washington,32LHRiof0sa4taYew9i3Fa,September In The Rain,03eWEA5wunWxo2NkZbMwLU, The leaves of brown Came tumblin down remember In September in the rain The sun went out Just like a dying ember That September in the rain To every word of love I heard you whisper The raindrops seemed to play A sweet refrain Though spring is here To me it s still September That September in the rain To every word of love I heard you whisper The raindrops seemed to play A sweet refrain Though spring is here To me it s still September That September in the rain That September in the rain
Dinah Washington,32LHRiof0sa4taYew9i3Fa,Cry Me A River,3hlRq4U3pouWh81Y9oh1Ua, Now you say you re lonely Said you cried the whole night through Well you can cry me a river Cry me a river Cause I cried a river over you Ooh Now you say you re sorry For being so untrue So what Just cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me Byebye my love You nearly drove me out of my head Byebye my love While you never shed a tear Remember I remember all you said Told me love was too plebeian Told me you were through with me And now you say you love me Well just to prove you do Go on and cry me a river I d like to see you cry me a river Cause I m tired of crying over You
Dinah Washington,32LHRiof0sa4taYew9i3Fa,I Don't Hurt Anymore,7FpiNXo1KPihSBCTjZhWH8, I do nt hurt anymore All my teardrops are dried No more walkin the floor With that burnin inside Just to think it could be Time has opened the door And at last I am free I do nt hurt anymore No use to deny I wanted to die The day you said we were through But now that I find you re out of my mind I ca nt believe that it s true I ve forgotten somehow That I cared so before And it s wonderful now I do nt hurt anymore
Dinah Washington,32LHRiof0sa4taYew9i3Fa,Teach Me Tonight,7kqvTohc8GmFJZYBPBnhTD, Did you say I ve got a lot to learn Well do nt think I m tryin not to learn Since this is the perfect spot to learn Oh teach me tonight Let s start with the A B C of it Roll right down to the X Y Z of it Help me solve the mystery of it Teach me tonight The sky s a black board High above you If a shooting star goes by I ll use that star to write I love you A thousand times across the sky One thing is nt very clear my love Should the teacher stand so near my love Graduation s almost here my love Come on and teach me tonight I ll use that star to write I love you A thousand times across the sky One thing is nt very clear my love Should the teacher stand so near my love Graduation s almost here my love Teach me please teach me tonight
