Marc E. Bassy,3tQx1LPXbsYjE9VwN1Peaa,Morning,54Yappwod1fELR5zb2gDBn, With no makeup on and your eyelash hanging I would still love you If you came home late and you kept me waiting I would still trust you If the richer man was looking at you Would you stay cold as a statue Would my love still be good for you Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise When I open up both eyes Be there in the mornin mornin mornin If I pass out drunk and you check my message And see my exes Would you still believe that it s only just us And I m not reckless Would you know if I ever laid with another lover We was on a break babe and I wore a rubber Would you forgive me Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise When I open up both eyes Be there in the mornin mornin mornin And last night last night I dreamed of a woman Dark brown eyes Daddy told her all she knows She brought me to life She set my soul in motion And there s only one thing I got ta know Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you be there in the mornin mornin mornin mornin Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise When I open up both eyes Be there in the mornin mornin mornin
Marc E.
