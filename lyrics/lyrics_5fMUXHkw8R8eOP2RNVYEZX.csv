Diplo,5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX,Sun In Our Eyes,58FDNEheGy0rsZskL7dyMm, I feel the sunlight on my head The scent of summer in my bed When we were footprints in the sand Stealing liquor making plans I can see your face from miles and miles away But heaven knows it s gon na fade heaven knows it s gon na fade I m a dog searching for reasons and a way Back to your hands you make me tremble make me crash Forget my name And just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes Yeah just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky No more tears for the night For the niiiiiight For the niiiiiight Yeah just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes They said to watch out for your kind I watched out and it blew my mind They say that romance makes you blind Well I ll be blinded for a lifetime But I can see your face from miles and miles away And I remember every kiss all the games you had me play I m a dog searching for answers and a way Back to your hands you make me tremble make me crash Forget my name And just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes Yeah just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky No more tears for the night For the niiiiiight For the niiiiiight Yeah just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la With the sun in your eyes La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la Ey I can see your face from miles and miles away But heaven knows it s gon na fade heaven knows it s gon na fade I m a dog searching for answers and a way Back to your hands you make me tremble make me crash Forget my name And just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes Yeah just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky No more tears for the night For the niiiiiight For the niiiiiight Yeah just ride that wave until we higher than life With the sun in our eyes
