Smokey Robinson & The Miracles,6TKOZZDd5uV5KnyC5G4MUt,I Second That Emotion,0ZUJJOh6eD2Vsp0DPIDn6m, Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet But only for one night with no repeat And maybe you d go away and never call And a taste of honey is worse than none at all Oh little girl In that case I do nt want no part I do believe that that would only break my heart Oh but if you feel like loving me If you got the notion I second that emotion Said if you feel like giving me A lifetime of devotion I second that emotion Maybe you ll think that love will tie you down And you do nt have the time to hang around And maybe you think that love was made for fools And so it makes you wise to break the rules Oh little girl In that case I do nt want no part I do believe that that would only break my heart Oh but if you feel like loving me If you got the notion I second that emotion Said if you feel like giving me A lifetime of devotion I second that emotion In that case I do nt want no part I do believe that that would only break my heart Oh but if you feel like loving me If you got the notion I second that emotion Said if you feel like giving me A lifetime of devotion I second that emotion I second that emotion
Smokey Robinson & The Miracles,6TKOZZDd5uV5KnyC5G4MUt,The Tears Of A Clown,1T9BMZj3BoFfWddYhyVc79, Oh yeah yeah yeah Now if there s a smile on my face It s only there trying to fool the public But when it comes down to fooling you Now honey that s quite a different subject But do nt let my glad expression Give you the wrong impression Really I m sad Oh I m sadder than sad You re gone and I m hurtin so bad Like a clown I pretend to be glad Now there s some sad things known to man But ai nt too much sadder than The tears of a clown When there s no one around Oh yeah baby Now if I appear to be carefree It s only to camouflage my sadness In order to shield my pride I ve tried To cover this hurt with a show of gladness But do nt let my show convince you That I ve been happy since you Decided to go Oh I need you so I m hurt and I want you to know But for others I put on a show Oh there s some sad things known to man But there ai nt too much sadder than The tears of a clown When there s no one around oh yeah Just like Pagliacci did I try to keep my sadness hid Smiling in the public eye But in my lonely room I cry The tears of a clown When there s no one around Oh yeah baby Now if there s a smile on my face Do nt let my glad expression Give you the wrong impression Do nt let this smile I wear Make you think that I do nt care Really I m sad Hurtin so bad
