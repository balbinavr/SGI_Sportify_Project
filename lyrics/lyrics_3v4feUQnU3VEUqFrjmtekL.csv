Faces,3v4feUQnU3VEUqFrjmtekL,Debris,2gFXQQ7dDY4lquHpUNeDTM, I left you on the Debris At the Sunday morning market You were sorting through the odds and ends You was looking for a bargain I heard your footsteps at the front door And that old familiar love song Cause you knew you d find me waiting there At the top of the stairs I went there and back Just to see how far it was And you you tried to tell me But I had to learn for myself There s more trouble at the depot With the general workers union And you said They ll never change a thing Well they wo nt fight and their not working Oh you was my hero How you are my good friend I ve been there and back And I know how far it is But I left you on the Debris Now we both know you got no money And I wonder what you would have done Without me hanging around
