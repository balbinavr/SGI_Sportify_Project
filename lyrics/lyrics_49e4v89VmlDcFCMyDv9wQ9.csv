Let It Snow!,2uFaJJtFpPDc5Pa95XzTvg, Oh the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And since we ve no place to go Let it snow let it snow let it snow Man it does nt show signs of stopping And I ve brought me some corn for popping The lights are turned way down low Let it snow let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight How I ll hate going out in the storm But if you really hold me tight All the way home I ll be warm And the fire is slowly dying And my dear we re still goodbying But as long as you love me so Let it snow let it snow and snow When we finally kiss goodnight How I ll hate going out in the storm But if you really grab me tight All the way home I ll be warm Oh the fire is slowly dying And my dear we re still goodbying But as long as you love me so Let it snow let it snow let it snow
