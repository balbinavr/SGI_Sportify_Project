Oscar Peterson,6zkX5fhrSD4tdVOmimR9wB,I've Got You Under My Skin,6gOb647lFVj8yhaakZ6imV, I ve got you under my skin I ve got you deep in the heart of me So deep in my heart that you re really a part of me I ve got you under my skin I d tried so not to give in I said to myself this affair never will go so well But why should I try to resist when baby I know down well I ve got you under my skin I d sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of havin you near In spite of a warnin voice that comes in the night And repeats repeats in my ear Do nt you know you fool you never can win Use your mentality wake up to reality But each time that I do just the thought of you Makes me stop before I begin Cause I ve got you under my skin I would sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of havin you near In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night And repeats how it yells in my ear Do nt you know you fool ai nt no chance to win Why not use your mentality get up wake up to reality And each time I do just the thought of you Makes me stop just before I begin Cause I ve got you under my skin And I like you under my skin
