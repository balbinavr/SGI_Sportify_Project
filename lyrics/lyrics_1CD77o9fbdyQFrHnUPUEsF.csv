Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,Light Up Or Leave Me Alone,6MeSDfZgtjw7k9QgdLxbNI, Sometimes I feel like I m fading away You re looking at me I ve got nothing to say Do nt make me angry with the games that you play Either light up or leave me alone You walk in my room you lie in my bed You open your mouth shoot someone dead All of a sudden you re inside my head Either light up or leave me alone Spending my bread like it grew on a tree You re trying to tell me bout the birds and the bees The skirt that you re wearing is way past your knees Either light up or leave me alone You re up all night preaching your mind Come home in the morning with your latest find I m gon na have to lay it to you straight on the line Either light up or leave me alone
Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,Feelin' Alright?,5eo3Oql60QR7NL2zcEsbe8, Seems I ve got to have a change of scene Cause every night I have the strangest dream Imprisoned by the way it could nt be Left here on my own or so it seems I ve got to leave before I start to scream But someone s locked the door and took the key Ya feelin all right I m not feelin too good myself Well ya feelin All right I m not feelin too good myself Well boy you sure took me for one big ride And even now I sit and wonder why That when I think of you I start to cry I just ca nt waste my time I must keep dry Got to stop believin in all your lies Cause there s too much to do before I die Ya feelin all right I m not feelin too good myself Well ya feelin all right I m not feelin too good myself Do nt get too lost in all I say Like the time I really felt that way But that was then and now it s today Ca nt get off yet and so I m here to stay Till someone comes along and takes my place With a different name yes and a different face Ya Feelin all right I m not feelin too good myself Well ya feelin all right I m not feelin too good myself

Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,The Low Spark Of High-Heeled Boys,1yW6y8RufwB4WEAQeip0tx, If you see something that looks like a star And it s shooting up out of the ground And your head is spinning from a loud guitar And you just ca nt escape from the sound Do nt worry too much it ll happen to you We were children once playing with toys And the thing that you re hearing is only the sound Of the low spark of high heeled boys The percentage you re paying is too high priced While you re living beyond all your means And the man in the suit has just bought a new car From the profit he s made on your dreams But today you just read that the man was shot dead By a gun that did nt make any noise But it was nt the bullet that laid him to rest Was the low spark of high heeled boys If you had just a minute to breathe And they granted you one final wish Would you ask for something like another chance Or something similar as this Do nt worry too much it ll happen to you As sure as your sorrows are joys And the thing that disturbs you is only the sound Of the low spark of high heeled boys The percentage you re paying is too high priced While you re living beyond all your means And the man in the suit has just bought a new car From the profit he s made on your dreams But today you just read that the man was shot dead By a gun that did nt make any noise But it was nt the bullet that laid him to rest Was the low spark of high heeled boys high heeled boys If I gave you everything that I owned And asked for nothing in return Would you do the same for me as I would for you Or take me for a ride And strip me of everything including my pride But spirit is something that no one destroys And the sound that I m hearing is only the sound of The low spark of high heeled boys Heeled boys
Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring,1wRvycpAMRdVEuQro58x4x, We are not like all the rest you can see us any day of the week Come around sit down take a sniff fall asleep Baby you do nt have to speak I d like to show you where it is but then it would nt even mean a thing Nothing is easy baby just please me who knows what tomorrow may bring If for just one moment you could step outside your mind And float across the ceiling I do nt think the folks would mind
Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,Empty Pages,3MT4gmgqhOxg6gyqnRQBzB, Found someone who can comfort me but there are always exceptions And she s good at appearing sane but I just want you to know She s the one makes me feel so good when everything is against me Picks me up when I m feeling down so I ve got something to show Staring at empty pages centered round the same old plot Staring at empty pages flowing along the ages Often lost and forgotten the vagueness and the mud I ve been thinking I m working too hard but I got something to show Staring at empty pages centered round the same old plot Staring at empty pages flowing along the ages Staring at empty pages centered round the same old plot Staring at empty pages flowing along the ages Often lost and forgotten the vagueness and the mud I d been thinking I m working too hard but I got something to show Your love Found someone who can comfort me but there are always exceptions And she s good at appearing sane but I just want you to know

Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,John Barleycorn,7Elpy1j2VMqspByPOATCMp, There were three men came out of the West Their fortunes for to try And these three men made a solemn vow John Barleycorn must die They ve ploughed they ve sown they ve harrowed him in Threw clods upon his head And these three men made a solemn vow John Barleycorn was dead They ve let him lie for a very long time Till the rains from heaven did fall And little Sir John sprung up his head And so amazed them all They ve let him stand till midsummer s day Till he looked both pale and wan And little Sir John s grown a long long beard And so become a man They ve hired men with the scythes so sharp To cut him off at the knee They ve rolled him and tied him by the way Serving him most barbarously They ve hired men with the sharp pitchforks Who pricked him to the heart And the loader he has served him worse than that For he s bound him to the cart They ve wheeled him around and around the field Till they came unto a barn And there they made a solemn oath On poor John Barleycorn They ve hired men with the crabtree sticks To cut him skin from bone And the miller he has served him worse than that For he s ground him between two stones And little Sir John and the nutbrown bowl And he s brandy in the glass And little Sir John and the nutbrown bowl Proved the strongest man at last The huntsman he ca nt hunt the fox Nor so loudly to blow his horn And the tinker he ca nt mend kettle nor pot Without a little Barleycorn
Traffic,1CD77o9fbdyQFrHnUPUEsF,Hidden Treasure,1egABo30OJfReG7YaiudDS, Take a walk down by take a walk down by the river There s a lot that you there s a lot that you can learn If you ve got a mind that s open if you ve got a heart that yearns If you listen to if you listen to the water You will hear the sound you will hear the sound of life There s a million different voices there is happiness and strife Message in the deep from a strange eternal sleep That is waiting there that is waiting there for you Like hidden treasure
