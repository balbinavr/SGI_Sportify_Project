Rosemary Clooney,0NkyXWGxE3WTFixDSJ39PK,Sway (with Prez Prado y Su Orquesta),3WI631zHHQ5PuSMkywWHGT, When marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me Make me sway Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore Hold me close Sway me more Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me Sway with ease When we dance you have a way with me Stay with me Sway with me Other dancers may be on the floor Dear but my eyes will see only you Only you have that magic technique When we sway I grow weak I can hear the sound of violins Long before It begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth Sway me now Quien sera el que me quiere a mi Quien sera Quien sera Quien sera el que me de su amor Quien sera Quien sera I can hear the sound of violins Long before It begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth Sway me now Sway me smooth Sway me now

Rosemary Clooney,0NkyXWGxE3WTFixDSJ39PK,The Night Before Christmas Song,7e2uGyRULGE43zolDDWhU2, Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there Then what to my wondering eyes should appear A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer A little old driver so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came As he shouted On Dasher and each reindeer s name And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas too Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound He was dressed allin fur and his belly was round He spoke not a word but went straight to his work And filled all the stocking then turned with a jerk And laying his finger aside of his nose Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night
