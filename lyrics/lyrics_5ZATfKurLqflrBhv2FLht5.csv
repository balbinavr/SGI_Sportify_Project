Horace Silver,5ZATfKurLqflrBhv2FLht5,Song For My Father,5klynmZw7TdqVsGvaxQH57, First Chorus This little song for my father Does things that no other Can do As I sing it to you It has a rhythm and rhyme That will fasten his memory In time As his beauty shines through For through my mind and soul My heart will always hold A special place for him It s true Second Chorus We bow our heads and we pray Every day s Father s Day Let s review All that he means to you Our mother s love is real nice But old Dad sacrificed For us too Let us give him his due We re very proud to be In his biography We sing this song for him And you
