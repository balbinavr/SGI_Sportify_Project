Adele,4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY,Someone Like You,4kflIGfjdZJW4ot2ioixTB, I heard that you re settled down That you found a girl and you re married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I did nt give to you Old friend why are you so shy Ai nt like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I could nt stay away I could nt fight it I had hoped you d see my face And that you d be reminded that for me it is nt over Never mind I ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Do nt forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I could nt stay away I could nt fight it I had hoped you d see my face And that you d be reminded that for me it is nt over Never mind I ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Do nt forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah Nothing compares no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes they re memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste Never mind I ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Do nt forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind I ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Do nt forget me I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
Adele,4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY,Make You Feel My Love,6P7tTFzn6oNa0GL8w8oazE, When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you have nt made your mind up yet But I will never do you wrong I ve known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I d go hungry I d go black and blue And I d go crawling down the avenue No there s nothing that I would nt do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ai nt seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy make your dreams come true Nothing that I would nt do Go to the ends of the earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my love
Adele,4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY,When We Were Young,7IWkJwX9C0J7tHurTD7ViL, Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the way you move Everybody here is watching you Cause you feel like home You re like a dream come true But if by chance you re here alone Can I have a moment Before I go Cause I ve been by myself all night long Hoping you re someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Cause nobody told me That you d be here And I swear you moved overseas That s what you said when you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young It s hard to win me back Everything just takes me back To when you were there To when you were there And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it has nt gone I guess I still care Do you still care It was just like a movie It was just like a song My God this reminds me Of when we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless Oh I m so mad I m getting old It makes me reckless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young
