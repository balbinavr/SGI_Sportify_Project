The Fray,0zOcE3mg9nS6l3yxt1Y0bK,How to Save a Life,5fVZC9GiM4e8vu99W0Xf6J, Step one you say We need to talk He walks you say Sit down it s just a talk He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Let him know that you know best Cause after all you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you ve told him all along And pray to God he hears you And pray to God he hears you Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or brake with the ones you ve followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he ll say he s just not the same And you ll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life

The Fray,0zOcE3mg9nS6l3yxt1Y0bK,Over My Head (Cable Car),1N62wozuHCvczCkY4QidpP, I never knew I never knew that everything was falling through That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue To turn and run when all I needed was the truth But that s how it s got to be It s comin down to nothing more than apathy I d rather run the other way than stay and see The smoke and who s still standing when it clears And everyone knows I m in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She s on your mind she s on your mind Let s rearrange I wish you were a stranger I could disengage Just say that we agree and then never change Soften a bit until we all just get along But that s disregard Find another friend and you discard As you lose the arguments in a cable car Hanging above as the canyon comes between And everyone knows I m in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She s on your mind she s on your mind Everyone knows I m in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She s on your mind she s on oh And suddenly I become a part of your past I m becoming the part that do nt last I m losing you and it s effortless Without a sound We lose sight of the ground in the throw around Never thought that you wanted to bring it down I wo nt let it go down till we torch it ourselves And everyone knows I m in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She s on your mind she s on your mind Everyone knows she s on your mind Everyone knows I m in over my head I m in over my head I m over my Everyone knows I m in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She s on your mind she s on your mind
