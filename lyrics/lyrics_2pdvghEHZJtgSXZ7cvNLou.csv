"Crosby, Stills & Nash",2pdvghEHZJtgSXZ7cvNLou,Dark Star,40lm5PFVQopOYaIXmyWNS9, Forgive me if my fantasies Might seem a little shopworn I m sure you ve heard it all before I wonder what s the right form Love songs written for you It s been going down for years But to sing what s in my heart Seems more honest than the tears I am curious Do nt wan na hurry us I m intrigued with us Ai nt this song a bust I do nt care dark star I met you several years ago The times they were so strange but I had a feelin You looked into my eyes just once An instant flashing by that we were stealing Another time you felt so bad And I was nt any help at all as I recall We did nt know quite what to do so we left the wanting be Still there for me and you Dark star I see you in the mornin Dark star a sleepin next to me Dark star let the memory of the evening be The first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me dark star It s easy to be with you Even with the storms that rage neath your search for peace We must make some time together Take the kids and find a world that s ours to keep And now you got me dreamin girl It s been so long I thought that I d forgotten how My heart is once again my soul We touched we did you know we did no more teasin now Dark star I see you in the mornin Dark star sleepin next to me Dark star let the memory of the evening be The first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me dark star Dark star I see you in the mornin Dark star a sleepin next to me Dark star let the memory of the evening be The first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me dark star Let the memory of the evening be The first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me dark star
"Crosby, Stills & Nash",2pdvghEHZJtgSXZ7cvNLou,Marrakesh Express,6lPbvFOOpN4pltOqJp7ddN, Whoopa hey mesa hooba huffa hey meshy goosh goosh Looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes Travelling the train through clear Moroccan skies Ducks and pigs and chickens call Animal carpet wall to wall American ladies fivefoot tall in blue Sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind Had to get away to see what we could find Hope the days that lie ahead Bring us back to where they ve led Listen not to what s been said to you Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express They re taking me to Marrakesh All aboard the train All aboard the train I ve been saving all my money just to take you there I smell the garden in your hair Take the train from Casablanca going south Blowing smoke rings from the corners of my mouth Colored cottons hang in the air Charming cobras in the square Striped djellebas we can wear at home Well let me hear ya now Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express They re taking me to Marrakesh Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express Would nt you know we re riding on the Marrakesh Express They re taking me to Marrakesh All aboard the train All aboard the train All aboard ooh
"Crosby, Stills & Nash",2pdvghEHZJtgSXZ7cvNLou,Just A Song Before I Go,4dAN7KcWCWx5jV6dpwtfvN, Just a song before I go To whom it may concern Traveling twice the speed of sound It s easy to get burned When the shows were over We had to get back home And when we opened up the door I had to be alone She helped me with my suitcase She stands before my eyes Driving me to the airport And to the friendly skies Going through security I held her for so long She finally looked at me in love And she was gone Just a song before I go A lesson to be learned Traveling twice the speed of sound It s easy to get burned
