NEEDTOBREATHE,610EjgFatGvVPtib97jQ8G,Brother (feat. Gavin DeGraw),62M9yafZsSRzlsphzeJPGo, Ramblers in the wilderness we ca nt find what we need Get a little restless from the searching Get a little worn down in between Like a bull chasing the matador is the man left to his own schemes Everybody needs someone beside em shining like a lighthouse from the sea Brother let me be your shelter I ll never leave you all alone I can be the one you call When you re low Brother let me be your fortress When the night winds are driving on Be the one to light the way Bring you home Face down in the desert now there s a cage locked around my heart I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were Now my hands ca nt reach that far I ai nt made for a robbery I could never take this world alone I know that in my weakness I am stronger It s your love that brings me home
