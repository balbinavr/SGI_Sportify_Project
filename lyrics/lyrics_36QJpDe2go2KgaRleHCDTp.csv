Led Zeppelin,36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp,Stairway To Heaven,5CQ30WqJwcep0pYcV4AMNc, There s a lady who s sure all that glitters is gold And she s buying a stairway to Heaven When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came for And she s buying a stairway to Heaven There s a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings In a tree by the brook there s a songbird who sings Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven It makes me wonder It makes me wonder There s a feeling I get when I look to the west And my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees And the voices of those who stand looking It makes me wonder It really makes me wonder And it s whispered that soon if we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to reason And a new day will dawn for those who stand long And the forests will echo with laughter If there s a bustle in your hedgerow do nt be alarmed now It s just a spring clean for the May Queen Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run There s still time to change the road you re on And it makes me wonder Your head is humming and it wo nt go in case you do nt know The piper s calling you to join him Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind oh And as we wind on down the road Our shadow s taller than our soul There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all yeah To be a rock and not to roll And she s buying a stairway to Heaven
Led Zeppelin,36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp,Immigrant Song,78lgmZwycJ3nzsdgmPPGNx, We come from the land of the ice and snow From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands To fight the horde and sing and cry Valhalla I am coming On we sweep with the threshing oar Our only goal will be the western shore We come from the land of the ice and snow From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore Of how we calmed the tides of war We are your overlords On we sweep with the threshing oar Our only goal will be the western shore So now you d better stop and rebuild all your ruins For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing
