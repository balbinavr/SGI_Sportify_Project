Sampha,2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm,Incomplete Kisses,4Pkst1hmHJ8dUdOaBqdee7, Those incomplete kisses Were weighing you down with every step In this house we re sinking But we re far too numb to really care The TV keeps glitching The lights dim down and portals appear And somehow you step out To say you re not by yourself now Those incomplete kisses Those incomplete kisses Wait too long you ll miss it Before long you re missing Do nt let your heart hide your story Do nt let your mind hide your story Cause if you deny others inside It gets harder to move along Moving on Flying high above all your memories I have a birdseye view A child stood at the cemetery He looks just like you Orange yellow purple blue skies A painting so true And I hear those cries Do nt you leave me here Do nt you leave me here Those incomplete kisses Those incomplete Wait too long you ll miss it Wait too long Those incomplete kisses Those incomplete Those incomplete kisses Those incomplete kisses Wait too long you ll miss it Before long you re missing Do nt let your heart hide your story Do nt let your mind hide your story Cause if you deny others inside It gets harder to move along Moving on Those incomplete kisses Were weighing you down with every step In this house we re sinking But we re too far numb to really care The TV keeps glitching The lights dim down and portals appear

Sampha,2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm,Trials of the Past,0SGccA9exVTuzQY7jwbASF, So young so how were you to know know know You re a carrier a carrier of the light inside of you Glows green in the pitch black night night night Ca nt tell anyone anyone it s hurting you So hold it in cover up pull up your sheets your sheets A torpedo cruising in the ocean and soon it s due So I got to sit up sit up oh up For my heart to come down down down down down So I got to sit up up up up up For my heart to come down down down down down The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls Ghostly enemies they come floating through you door And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall From the past from the past and they re somewhere right before you like The Ghost of Christmas Past I was always floating around the cittty Going with the flow without ever knowing where I wan na be So I got into crazy situaations A loyal soldier who acts who acts who acts But never asks Why am I flying on my back my back With the moon looking down down down down down Where s my band Where s anything at all all And why s the ceiling going black black black black black The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls Ghostly enemies they come floating through you door And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall From the past from the past and they re somewhere right before you like The Ghost of Christmas Past No that hurts and anything s coming unless you go And you ca nt break the chasing ghosts ghosts ghosts So much so When they come back but never ask At your side at your soul When they come back but never ask The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls Ghostly enemies they come floating through you doll And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall From the past from the past and they re somewhere right before you like The Ghost of Christmas Past
Sampha,2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm,Close But Not Quite,7hfGhtkWBWiam6LlsIgATD, Fate lets you fall into her arms without a word And only the size of your breath that hurts I m not one to go to church But you made me believe in something more than hurt I feel like I do nt have the words I feel like I do nt have the words Because I ca nt speak Am I so naive I feel like I do nt have the words Because I ca nt speak Of these words I ve tried to recite They are close but not quite Of these words I ve tried to recite They are close but not quite I m so misunderstood I m so misunderstood I m so misunderstood I m so misunderstood I do nt know what to believe in I guess your eyes said enough I guess your sigh said enough All of these words no they ca nt express pain It s like my life ended there s not words that I ve learned Oh and these are just words And they ca nt express pain These are just words oh words That ca nt express the pain the pain in my soul Speak the unspoken A monster got woken up and now now I m in his part Of these words I ve tried to recite They are close but not quite Almost impossible to do Reciting the makings of you

Sampha,2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm,Reverse Faults,5IRLnB7JqTMcIlMtE0Rcuv, There s a fault in my structure It s always you and never me I threw the blame and it shattered And now there s broken glass praying to be healed You struck a chord and I listened You damn near broke all the strings When you get close I get distant Instead I ll drive away to a place surreal And tell me how that feels Took the brake pads out the car And I flew Smashed this window in my heart And I blamed you This anger s taking me apart Explosive truths Except this time I went too far And I hurt you I wish I could take it back right now Where s that smile when it matters Where was I when you called I shot the blame and it scattered Now there s bullet holes spread across the walls I took the shape of a letter Slipped myself underneath your door In this red room we develop An understanding of all our wrongs Now can we move along Took the brake pads out the car And I flew Smashed this window in my heart And I blamed you This anger s taking me apart Explosive truths Except this time I went too far And I hurt you I wish I could take it back right now
Sampha,2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm,Treasure,6mtnu7p8tkUzlDO3KOoaTY, I was somewhere two thousand and daydream I was hot that I could nt face things I used to live my life in this I fell out of sync audio phasing Felt like I could nt find my placing Sky shivers there They turn to rain I turn again I wish we could heal I ll take you home I ll make you whole You made me wish That this was nt real Because youre You re my treasure Because youre You re my treasure I used to live my life in the wind And I would fly wherever you would swim I could nt stand by you or anything Sky shivers there They turn to rain I turn again I wish we could heal I ll take you home I ll make you whole You made me wish That this was nt real Because youre You re my treasure Because youre You re my treasure Bad habits and good times Lets take a risk no nine lives Do nt smile you might just cry Been round the roundabout like five times Two scratches hard drive appetites decline Watch the heavens just recline Watch the heavens lest the sun die Breathing even is a challenge Cause I do nt want to lose brother I need it got ta have it Too stuck in the loop Still stuck in the loop
