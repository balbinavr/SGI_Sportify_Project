John Denver,7EK1bQADBoqbYXnT4Cqv9w,Perhaps Love,7vRLVWAYjnrPEhZf5IeDOm, Perhaps love is like a resting place a shelter from the storm It exists to give you comfort it is there to keep you warm And in those times of trouble when you are most alone The memory of love will bring you home Perhaps love is like a window perhaps an open door It invites you to come closer it wants to show you more And even if you lose yourself and do nt know what to do The memory of love will see you through Love to some is like a cloud to some as strong as steel For some a way of living for some a way to feel And some say love is holding on and some say letting go And some say love is everything and some say they do nt know Perhaps love is like the ocean full of conflict full of change Like a fire when it s cold outside or thunder when it rains If I should live forever and all my dreams come true My memories of love will be of you
