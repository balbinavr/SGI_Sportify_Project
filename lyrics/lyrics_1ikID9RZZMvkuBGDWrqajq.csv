Keiynan Lonsdale),14oTuzcNwzAsBqzv5NRv6U, Somehow we lost our way I dont know how we did it We went so off course And now you hide to numb your pain Does this mean that were over Got ta let me know Yeah the ball is rolling past the two of us But your feet aint moving are you cool with us And Im caught in your mind but its like youve had enough I wish youd just tell me to go Oh lay it on me yo Oh lay it on me yo Im saying Were caught in stone you know we might not make it Oh lay it on me yo Oh lay it on me yo Im saying This love is holding us but are we gon na make it Oh lay it on me yo Im saying Oh lay it on me yo but are we gon na make it How did I go wrong Thought Id belong with you its right now Im feeling afraid that I could lose you somehow And Im paddling fast faster than fast But are we slowly sinking Tell me what are you thinking See the ball is rolling past the two of us But your feet aint moving are you cool with us And Im caught in your mind but its like youve had enough I wish youd just tell me to go Oh lay it on me yo Oh lay it on me yo Im saying Were caught in stone you know we might not make it Oh lay it on me yo Oh lay it on me yo Im saying This love is holding us but are we gon na make it Oh lay it on me yo Im saying Oh lay it on me yo but are we gon na make it
