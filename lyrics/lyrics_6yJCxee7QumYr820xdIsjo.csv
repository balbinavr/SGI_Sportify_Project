Zac Brown Band,6yJCxee7QumYr820xdIsjo,Chicken Fried,4dGJf1SER1T6ooX46vwzRB, You know I like my chicken fried An cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine And that s home you know Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine Where the peaches grow And my house it s not much to talk about But it s filled with love that s grown in Southern ground And a little bit o chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up I like to see a sunrise See the love in my woman s eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother s love Well it s funny how it s the little things in life That mean the most Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes There s no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I ve come to know So if you agree have a drink with me Raise your glasses for a toast To a little bit o chicken fried An cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I ve seen a sunrise See the love in my woman s eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother s love I thank God for my life And for the stars and stripes May freedom forever fly Let it ring Salute the ones who died The ones that give their lives So we do nt have to sacrifice All the things we love Like our chicken fried An cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up I like to see the sunrise See the love in my woman s eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother s love Get ya little chicken fried An cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up I like to see a sunrise See the love in my woman s eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother s love
Zac Brown Band,6yJCxee7QumYr820xdIsjo,Toes,5kjyiH6but1t2UDXq15aeS, I got my toes in the water ass in the sand Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand Life is good today Life is good today Well the plane touched down just about 3 oclock And the city s still on my mind Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head I was still in the baggage line Concrete and cars are their own prison bars Like this life I m living in But the plane brought me farther I m surrounded by water And I m not going back again I got my toes in the water ass in the sand Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand Life is good today Life is good today Adios and vaya con dios Yeah I m leaving GA And if it were nt for tequila and pretty senoritas I d have no reason to stay Adios and vaya con dios Yeah I m leaving GA Gon na lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one And grab my guitar and play The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night As the summer drew to an end They ca nt believe that I just could nt leave And I bid adieu to my friends Cause my bartender she s from the islands Her body s been kissed by the sun And coconut replaces the smell of the bar And I do nt know if it s her or the rum I got my toes in the water ass in the sand Not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand Life is good today Life is good today Adios and vaya con dios A long way from GA Yes and all the muchachas they call me big poppa When I throw pesos their way Adios and vaya con dios A long way from GA Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger And I ll grab my guitar and play Adios and vaya con dios Going home now to stay The senoritas do nt careo when there s no dinero I got no money to stay Adios and vaya con dios Going home now to stay Just gon na prop up by the lake And put my ass in a lawn chair toes in the clay Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way Life is good today Life is good today
Zac Brown Band,6yJCxee7QumYr820xdIsjo,Knee Deep (feat. Jimmy Buffett),1yEwEiTpsaPhQi9lb5EVV4, Gon na put the the world away for a minute Pretend I do nt live in it Sunshine gon na wash my blues away Had sweet love but I lost it She got too close so I fought her Now I m lost in the world trying to find me a better way Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze and it do nt seem fair Only worry in the world is the tide gon na reach my chair Sunrise there s a fire in the sky Never been so happy never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise Wrote a note said be back in a minute Bought a boat and I sailed off in it Do nt think anybody s gon na miss me anyway Mind on a permanent vacation The ocean is my only medication Wishing my condition ai nt ever gon na go away Cause now I m knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gon na reach my chair Sunrise there s a fire in the sky Never been so happy never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise This champagne shore washing over me It s a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea One day you could be as lost as me Change your geography Maybe you might be Knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gon na reach my chair Sunrise there s a fire in the sky Never been so happy never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise Come on in the water it s nice Find yourself a little slice Grab a backpack of lies You never know until you try When you lose yourself You find the key to paradise

Zac Brown Band,6yJCxee7QumYr820xdIsjo,From Now On,3Ksw1diWULifMLaV2oTYtU, I saw the sun begin to dim And felt that winter wind blow cold A man learns who is there for him When the glitter fades and the walls wo nt hold Cause from then rubble What remains can only be what s true If all was lost it s more I ve gained Cause it led me back to you And from now on these eyes will not be blinded by the lights From now on what s waited til tomorrow starts tonight tonight And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart From now on from now on I drank champagne with kings and queens The politicians praised my name But those are someone else s dreams The pitfalls of the man I became For years and years I chased their cheers At the crazy speed of always needing more But when I stop and see you here I remember who all this was for And from now on these eyes will not be blinded by the lights And from now on what s waited til tomorrow starts tonight It starts tonight And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart From now on from now on from now on And we will come back home And we will come back home home again And we will come back home And we will come back home home again And we will come back home And we will come back home home again From now on these eyes will not be blinded by the lights And from now on what s waited til tomorrow starts tonight It starts tonight And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart From now on from now on from now on And we will come back home And we will come back home home again And we will come back home And we will come back home home again From now on from now on home again
