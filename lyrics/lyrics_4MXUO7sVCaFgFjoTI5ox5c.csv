Sufjan Stevens,4MXUO7sVCaFgFjoTI5ox5c,The Only Thing,6Rt6KwuF7I8ZkdZG2G0bYr, The only thing that keeps me from driving this car Halflight jackknife into the canyon at night Signs and wonders Perseus aligned with the skull Slain Medusa Pegasus alight from us all Do I care if I survive this Bury the dead where they re found In a veil of great surprises I wonder did you love me at all The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm Crosshatch warm bath Holiday Inn after dark Signs and wonders water stain writing the wall Daniel s message blood of the moon on us all Do I care if I despise this Nothing else matters I know In a veil of great disguises How do I live with your ghost Should I tear my eyes out now Everything I see returns to you somehow Should I tear my heart out now Everything I feel returns to you somehow I want to save you from your sorrow The only reason why I continue at all Faith in reason I wasted my life playing dumb Signs and wonders sea lion caves in the dark Blind faith God s grace nothing else left to impart Do I care if I survive this Bury the dead where they re found In a veil of great surprises Hold to my head till I drown Should I tear my eyes out now Before I see too much Should I tear my arms out now I want to feel your touch Should I tear my eyes out now Everything I see returns to you somehow Should I tear my heart out now Everything I feel returns to you somehow
Sufjan Stevens,4MXUO7sVCaFgFjoTI5ox5c,Mystery of Love (From the Original Motion Picture Call Me by Your Name),0oTtnnedK0C4unALxVTPhz, Oh to see without my eyes The first time that you kissed me Boundless by the time I cried I built your walls around me White noise what an awful sound Fumbling by Rogue River Feel my feet above the ground Hand of God deliver me Oh oh woeohwoah is me The first time that you touched me Oh will wonders ever cease Blessed be the mystery of love Lord I no longer believe Drowned in living waters Cursed by the love that I received From my brother s daughter Like Hephaestion who died Alexander s lover Now my riverbed has dried Shall I find no other Oh oh woeohwoah is me I m running like a plover Now I m prone to misery The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me How much sorrow can I take Blackbird on my shoulder And what difference does it make When this love is over Shall I sleep within your bed River of unhappiness Hold your hands upon my head Till I breathe my last breath Oh oh woeohwoah is me The last time that you touched me Oh will wonders ever cease Blessed be the mystery of love

Sufjan Stevens,4MXUO7sVCaFgFjoTI5ox5c,Death with Dignity,4fpEuKIzTLmMJnYwFU0oqr, Spirit of my silence I can hear you But I m afraid to be near you And I do nt know where to begin And I do nt know where to begin Somewhere in the desert there s a forest And an acre before us But I do nt know where to begin But I do nt know where to begin Again I ve lost my strength completely Oh be near me Tired old mare With the wind in your hair Amethyst and flowers on the table Is it real or a fable Well I suppose a friend is a friend And we all know how this will end Chimney swift that finds me be my keeper Silhouette of the cedar What is that song you sing for the dead What is that song you sing for the dead I see the signal searchlight strike me In the window of my room Well I got nothing to prove Well I got nothing to prove I forgive you mother I can hear you And I long to be near you But every road leads to an end Yes every road leads to an end Your apparition passes through me In the willows five red hens You ll never see us again You ll never see us again

Sufjan Stevens,4MXUO7sVCaFgFjoTI5ox5c,Casimir Pulaski Day,1u1YU1LE0FWHFOHpR2iXua, Two three four Goldenrod and the 4H stone The things I brought you When I found out you had cancer of the bone Your father cried on the telephone And he drove his car into the Navy yard Just to prove that he was sorry In the morning through the window shade When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade I could see what you were reading All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications you could do without When I kissed you on the mouth Tuesday night at the Bible study We lift our hands and pray over your body But nothing ever happens I remember at Michael s house In the living room when you kissed my neck And I almost touched your blouse In the morning at the top of the stairs When your father found out what we did that night And you told me you were scared All the glory when you ran outside With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied And you told me not to follow you Sunday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out With the pictures of your mother On the floor at the great divide With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied I am crying in the bathroom In the morning when you finally go And the nurse runs in with her head hung low And the cardinal hits the window In the morning in the winter shade On the first of March on the holiday I thought I saw you breathing All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications when I see His face In the morning in the window All the glory when He took our place But He took my shoulders and He shook my face And He takes and He takes and He takes
