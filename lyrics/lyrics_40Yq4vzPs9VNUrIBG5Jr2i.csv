The Smashing Pumpkins,40Yq4vzPs9VNUrIBG5Jr2i,Drown,3eMYc6FK9XvyauIaxcJtRS, No matter where you are I can still hear you when you drown You ve traveled very far Just to see you I ll come around When I m down All of those yesterdays Coming down No matter where you are I can still hear you when you dream You traveled very far You traveled far like a star And you are All of those yesterdays Coming down Is it something someone said Was it something someone said Yesterday the sky was you And I still feel the same Nothing left for me to do And I still feel the same I wish I wish I could fly I wish I wish I could lie I will I will try I will I will Goodbye
The Smashing Pumpkins,40Yq4vzPs9VNUrIBG5Jr2i,Marchin' On,5Tl80CRXHnJEtqQbIftis8, She kills the empty clock she kills the empty clock She haunts you where you re not she haunts you where you re not She screams the ailing arks are spirals full of shock She stabs the empty clock she stabs the empty clock And bowing down there as a violet rose Yet swingin alarm you come body and soul September s dear dread is her evening s code Cause if you re still my witness Body and soul Cause if you re still my sickness Body and soul Oh sweet blush of orchid Body and soul Oh baby I m still your witness Body and soul Marchin on we ve gone pennymad And marchin on we become the sad Mind for soul but a body for us We re body and soul She stabs the empty clock She haunts them where they re not She screams your ailing arks are spirals full of shock She stabs them where they re not As body slays soul Cause if you re still my witness Body and soul Cause if you re still my sickness Body and soul Oh sweet blush of orchid Body and soul Oh baby I m still your witness Body and soul
