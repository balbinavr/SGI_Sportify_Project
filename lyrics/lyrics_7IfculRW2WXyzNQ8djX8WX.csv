Erykah Badu,7IfculRW2WXyzNQ8djX8WX,You Got Me,4pdLZsxq0y5oJDb6Cxlokw, Eryka 1 If you were worried bout where I been or who I saw or What club I went to with my homies Baby do nt worry you know that you got me If you were worried bout where I been or who I saw or What club I went to with my homies Baby do nt worry you know that you got me Roots Somebody told me that this planet was small We used to live in the same building on the same floor And never met before until I m overseas on tour And peep this Ethiopian Queen from Philly Taking classes abroad She studying film in photo flash focus record Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score She said she love my show in Paris at Elyse Montmartre And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart We knew from the start that things fall apart Intentions shatter she like that shit do nt matter When I get home get at her through letter phone Whatever let s link let s get together Shit you think not Think that Thought went home and forgot Time passed we back in Philly she up in my spot Telling me the things I m telling her is makin her hot Started building with her constantly round the clock Now she in my world like hiphop and keep telling me Roots Yo I m the type that s always catchin a flight And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night And that s when she flip and get on some ol Eryka Another loney night Seems like I m on the side you only lovin your mic I know you got ta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight But yo I need some sort of love in my life you dig me While politicin with my sister from New York City She said she know this ball player and he think I m pretty Psych I m playin boo you know it s just with you I m stayin boo And when cats be poppin game I do nt hear what they sayin boo When you out there in the world I m still your girl With all my classes I do nt have the time for life s thrills So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme And do nt be listenin to your homies they be leadin you blind Roots Yeah so what you sayin I can trust you Eryka Is you crazy You my king for real Both But sometimes relationships get ill Eryka No doubt Roots That snake could be that chick and that rat Could be that cool cat that s whisperin She s trying to play you for the fool black If something s on your chest then let it be known See I m not your everyfiveminutes all on the phone And on the topic of trust it s just a matter of fact That people bite back and fracture what s intact And they ll forever be I ai nt on some Oh I m a celebrity I deal wit the real so if it s artificial let it be I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds Listening to they squaws and listenin to they girlfriends That s exactly the point where they whole world ends Lies come in that s where the drama begins And she like yo
