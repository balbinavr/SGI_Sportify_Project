Elvin Bishop,2G1yVp387GlUf9yvLk6V11,Sure Feels Good,4dNJLLbjNCpwuveBHha2dF, I never seen such a beautiful day Looked like everything is coming my way Feel like a bird just leaving a cage Looks like my luck is Getting ready to change Sure feels good feeling good again Sure feels good feeling good Feels good again The sun just came out From behind a cloud Now I feel like shouting out loud Hallelujah let the sun shine in Hallelujah I m feeling alright again Sure feels good feeling good again Sure feels good feeling good Feels good again Feels so good feels so good I wore out nine pairs of shoes Walking this old floor Never sang nothing but the blues Now I m singing me a brand new song Standing in a new pair of shoes Sure feels good feeling good again Sure feels good feeling good Feels good again Sure feels good feeling Good ai nt the word for it Sure feels good feeling Good it s good good good Sure feels good feeling
