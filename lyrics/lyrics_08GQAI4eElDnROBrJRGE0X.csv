Fleetwood Mac,08GQAI4eElDnROBrJRGE0X,Landslide,5ihS6UUlyQAfmp48eSkxuQ, I took my love I took it down I climbed a mountain and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills Till the landslide brought me down Oh mirror in the sky What is love Can the child within my heart rise above Can I sail through the changing ocean tides Can I handle the seasons of my life Well I ve been afraid of changing Cause I ve built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I m getting older too Well I ve been afraid of changing Cause I ve built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I m getting older too Oh I m getting older too I take my love I take it down Oh I climb a mountain and turned around And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well the landslide will bring you down And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well the landslide will bring you down Oh the landslide will bring it down
Fleetwood Mac,08GQAI4eElDnROBrJRGE0X,Gypsy,19Ym5Sg0YyOCa6ao21bdoG, So I m back to the Velvet Underground Back to the floor that I love To a room with some lace and paper flowers Back to the gypsy that I was To the gypsy that I was Dodododo And it all comes down to you Well you know that it does well Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice Oh and it lights up the night And you see your gypsy You see your gypsy To the gypsy that remains She faces freedom With a little fear I have no fear I have only love And if I was a child And the child was enough Enough for me to love Enough to love She is dancing away from you now She was just a wish She was just a wish And her memory is all that is left for you now You see your gypsy oh You see your gypsy oohooh Oh Ohohohoh Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice And it all comes down to you Ooh oh And it all comes down to you Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice And it all comes down to you Oh I still see your your bright eyes bright eyes And it all comes down to you
