Lil Dicky,1tqhsYv8yBBdwANFNzHtcr,Professional Rapper (feat. Snoop Dogg),1Ysc1uDZtf430TGavoS1j4, Hello how can I help you Hi my name s Dave Burd I have an appointment today It s probably under Lil Dicky actually I m a I m a rapper so Okay and who are you here to see Uh Snoop Dogg Says here Snoop Dogg Oh yeah He s right down the hall First door to your right Give him a knock and he should be right with you Thanks It s uh this door right here right Mmhmm Thank you Grab a seat Thanks I m Dave very nice to meet Dave what it do You can call me Dogg Let me just check your sheet No problem sir let me just say I m a big fan of the shit that yall make I ca nt lie I been thinking about this all day All good there s a reason that we called Dave let me start with your background Where you come from Sure I was undergrad down there in Richmond Before that Oh you talking bout my hometown Yeah I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham It was in the suburbs uppermiddle wealth around So real shit you ai nt never had to struggle for much I would nt say it like that we just had a different kind of trap Elaborate Well I ai nt never had a tool but I had to be the man at school Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad I m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted But the job you wanted was nt all that bumping Yeah and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that When you been racing them rats you ai nt been making them raps Boo hoo what a hardship How you paid to get the rap shit started Man my Bar Mitzvah money But do nt diss me buddy I was nt one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose I must ve wanted this a lot I had something to choose Ha look at that I can say there s something to prove up in your ass Yeah I guess That s enough of the past what makes you want to do rap Oh my god it s the best Bitches let me draw up on their breasts Literally I can reinvent myself I get a forum to project myself It s never boring every morning I wake up and try to best myself I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself It s kinda healthy Cool now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals Sure In a club and a couple niggas threaten you Uh I would nt do shit And I do nt even get what that got to do with this Shut the fuck up rap s like life If you wan na do this then you wo nt get far acting like a little bitch Nah that s my niche Do nt get offended by this but that s the market yall missed That s the target I ll hit And that s the heart of my pitch I wan na do this whole thing different What the fuck you mean you wan na do the whole thing different Uh you know II think like you know Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time But traditionally speaking this shit works right Nah like I get that but II just think that you know You do nt know if it could be working even better And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out I do nt mean any disrespect by that I m just saying I have a different background Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant So what are your biggest strengths Well my flow is crazy I can switch that amazing For example I can be like ai nt nobody fucking with Lil Dicky When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous Ripping this shit like it s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable Cause I can switch it deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer Alright alright I get it Top of that lyrically I m pretty damn clever Go Got a long bottom bitch call the hoe Neville Whoa And I blow it from the jump Derrick Rose knee Oh You can say I m pretty smart how I know better And yall been winning like Pistorius it s no feat Bro I can go on and on I m taking over and they mad like fatherinlaws OK enough of the punchline that ai nt showing me you different than the other guys Well I do nt know if they can run it like that But ai nt nobody else doing funny type rap What s that Well I can tell a story about my morning Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence Like the 14 year old Topanga Oh this shit like a joke to you I do nt get it Nah it ai nt like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual Like as a guy So when I get up on the mic I ai nt finna just lie Real recognize real right Yeah I guess so what you tryna do Five years from now tell me bout the dude Well I do nt care about the money Like it s the respect that I m wanting Honestly I just want to be one of the greats Where they got ta bring your boy up every debate I do nt wan na leave the game the same In a nutshell what s your legacy Well I wan na be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap Put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was antirap Yet the fans of rap start to recognize that antirap Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left That shit sound pretty damn complex I guess I wan na be the best I just wan na do it my way And turn the whole game sideways And show people you ai nt got ta be resigned to the highway You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight I ai nt mad at that Well thanks man that s my plan of my attack Just let me in and Imma rap the plaques And I ai nt about to win them back to back I m bout to win them like it s back to back to back to back to back Till I stop rapping You ai nt even sold a damn album yet True That s a lot of talk from a wily vet Let alone a young rook nigga You misread me Nah this ai nt a book nigga Well that s one of my flaws I m too competitive dawg No you just fucking repetitive dawg I get it you trying to be better than all but you ai nt shit until cheddar s involved I get that I got ta prove myself No shit you ai nt done shit Think about that though Only doing this a couple of years One tape and I m like this This shit is aight for your first shit But you do nt know if it s your worst shit You do nt think finding out would be worth it It might be it might not But Imma put your ass to work kid Wait like like I have the job Like really Well one more thing let me see if you could put a hook together What would you do for the hook for this song You want me to make a hook up right now Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself Alright uh okay Man do the hook I m bout to be professional Homie I m professional Uh maybe like a low voice type thing Nigga that shit is garbage man Well you know I feel like there might have been some upside to it But I m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that Do nt yall normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes Sometimes but you know that was some next level Dogg shit right there Yeah you know I m just way better when I get to think things through Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing Whatever man you trying to smoke a blunt Right now Yeah Sure Dope Juanita bring some weed in here please Thank you You got it Snoop I ll be right there Thanks Juanita Super nice woman Nigga why does everything you say sound so soft Uh I really do nt wan na be spoken to like that so Whatever Thanks Hey I got yall
