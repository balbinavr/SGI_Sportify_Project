Chris Rea,5KEG7G8LDYlHgFDqZyEEs2,Looking For The Summer,2hTXUPiLY6GyUxESfOSKpL, Look deep INTO the April face A change is clearly taking place Looking for the summer The eyes take on a certain gaze And leave behind the springtime days Go looking for the summer This ai nt no game of kiss and tell The implications how you KNEW so well Go looking for the summer The time has come and they must go To play the passion out that haunts you so Looking for the summer Remember love how it was the same We scratched and hurt each OTHER S growing pains We were looking for the summer And still I stand this very day With a burning wish to fly away I m still looking looking for the summer
