Carrie Underwood,4xFUf1FHVy696Q1JQZMTRj,Church Bells,67citk3uzWs5qbaIVKTeg8, Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy Out in the shack with a blue tick hound Broke as hell but blessed with beauty The kind that a rich man ca nt turn down She caught the eye of an oil man dancing One summer night in a dime store dress She had the looks he had the mansion And you can figure out the rest It was all roses dripping in diamonds sipping on champagne She was all uptown wearing that white gown taking his last name She could hear those church bells ringing ringing And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah it s all gon na be alright And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing Yeah they re ringing Jenny was hosting Junior League parties And having dinner at the country club Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie But Ken was always getting way too drunk Saturday night after a few too many He came home ready to fight And all his money could never save Jenny From the devil living in his eyes It was all bruises covered in makeup dark sunglasses And that next morning sitting in the back pew praying with the baptist She could hear those church bells ringing ringing And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah it s all gon na be alright You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing Yeah they re ringing Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee Whiskey No law man was ever gon na find And how he died is still a mystery But he hit a woman for the very last time She could hear those church bells ringing ringing And standing there in a black dress singing singing Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah it s all gon na be alright And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing Yeah they re ringing
