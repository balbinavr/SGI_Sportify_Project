The Staples),3TKOJWYOMrp98OB19y1A0n, I pulled into Nazareth was feelin about half past dead I just need some place where I can lay my head Hey mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed He just grinned and shook my hand and No was all he said Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And you put the load right on me I picked up my bag I went lookin for a place to hide When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin side by side I said Hey Carmen come on let s go downtown She said I got ta go but my friend can stick around Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And you put the load right on me Go down Miss Moses there s nothin you can say It s just ol Luke and Luke s waitin on the Judgement Day Well Luke my friend what about young Anna Lee He said Do me a favor son wo nt you stay and keep Anna Lee company Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And you put the load right on me Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog He said I will fix your rack if you ll take Jack my dog I said Wait a minute Chester you know I m a peaceful man He said That s okay boy wo nt you feed him when you can Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And you put the load right on me Catch a cannon ball now ttake me down the line My bag is sinkin low and I do believe it s time To get back to Miss Fanny you know she s the only one Who sent me here with her regards for everyone Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And you put the load right on me
