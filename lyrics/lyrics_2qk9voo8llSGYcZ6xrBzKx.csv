Kings of Leon,2qk9voo8llSGYcZ6xrBzKx,Waste A Moment,5LlsD7LdSMkGV4Iu0a2Zq0, All the way from Waco to WeHo With a rabbit on her chain Drove a little slick car to tend bar With the static on her brain She s a little burner burner Gon na throw you to the flame Little ticking time bomb time bomb Gon na blow us all away Ooh Take the time to waste a moment Ooh Never ask to be forgiven Tex he was her boyfriend with no kin Always running from the law Every other weekend the week ends With his back in her claw He s a live wire wired Shooting sparks in the night He s a gun for hire hired With a bead in his sights Ooh Take the time to waste a moment Ooh Facing where the lines are broken Ooh Name your price to all this living Ooh Never ask to be forgiven Ooh Take the time to waste a moment Ooh Facing where the lines are broken Ooh Name your price to all this living Ooh Never ask to be forgiven
Kings of Leon,2qk9voo8llSGYcZ6xrBzKx,Closer,1O8d2pWtBclzuY3FctBPVa, Stranded in the spooky town Stoplights are swaying and the phone lines are down The floor is crackling cold She took my heart I think she took my soul With the moon I run Far from the carnage of the fiery sun Driven by the strangle of vein Showing no mercy I d do it again Open up your eye You keep on crying baby I ll bleed you dry The skies they blink at me I see a storm bubbling up from the sea Now it s coming closer Now it s coming closer You shimmy shook my bone Leaving me stranded all in love on my own Do you think of me Where am I now baby where do I sleep Feels so good but I m old Two thousand years of chasing taking its toll Now it s coming closer Now it s coming closer Now it s coming closer Now it s coming closer
Kings of Leon,2qk9voo8llSGYcZ6xrBzKx,Reverend,5cm47Nc1MWBVIkRFaXxvHY, On the lam cut down in the middle of the night Caught in a trap Crushed by the cry of a wandering man Who was never coming back Stuck on the line spending all of his time With his back to the throne With the flash of the round everybody in town Said Leave it alone Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio Your heart will never say so Your heart will never let it go Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio My heart will never say so My heart will never let you go I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight Facing the ground Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile As it passes around The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes Is nt working on me Do nt you think you got ta give give me something I want Give me something I need whoa Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio Your heart will never say so Your heart will never let it go Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio My heart will never say so My heart will never let you go Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio Your heart will never say so Your heart will never let it go Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio My heart will never say so My heart will never let you go Just like the reverend like the reverend on the radio My heart will never say so My heart will never let you go
