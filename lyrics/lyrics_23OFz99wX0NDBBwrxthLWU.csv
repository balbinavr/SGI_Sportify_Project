The Lacs,23OFz99wX0NDBBwrxthLWU,Just Another Thing (feat. Crucifix),6aiap0DxIpyscSAIaPp9kk, Oh It s just another thing to me Another day on the grind for a couple cents I kiss goodbye to my benefits Work throws stone while I ride the fence I m old and old enough to bring up something that makes sense It s like I m livin in a war zone And they can write it on my tombstone Here lies a man who do nt cry With ash on the feet in front pillar heels I ve been up And I ve been down But my place ai nt on the ground I d rather me death on my feet Life on my knees Trouble ai nt nothin But another damn thing to me I ve been up And I ve been down And I ve been beat And pushed around I ll pick myself up off the ground Just wait and see Cause it s just another thing to me Just another bridge I ll have to burn Just another lesson I m bound to learn Buddy ai nt damn thing changin me So watch and see Cause it s just another thing to me You know it ai nt a thing with it So I focus on the game but I ca nt get it I got my people wonderin if I still got it So I m reachin out the window for my pill bottle And I will follow Devil wan na ride with me But I ai nt lettin him I got a lot of my problems But I ai nt stressin I m on a path of my past Of my days gone I keep on fightin And I m tryin to find my way home Head to the sky And ride just to stay strong My time tickin quicker Like I m on a payphone They do nt wan na hire me Cause my piss is cloudy Lookin down but they do nt know nothin bout me They bringin the wickedest sickest person Out of my soul So I m takin em makin em Work down them old dirt roads I rearrange some things But there ai nt no changin me Man it s plain to see It s just another thing to me I ve been up And I ve been down And I ve been beat And pushed around I ll pick myself up off the ground Just wait and see Cause it s just another thing to me Just another bridge I ll have to burn Just another lesson I m bound to learn Buddy ai nt damn thing changin me So watch and see It s just another thing to me It s in the past man so do nt think about that Made some real bad choices I ca nt take back That s why I do nt brag about the things I own Cause I can make a wrong turn and it ll all be gone I still bust my ass to make ends meet I understand a better plan is on it s way for me And hey it s just another day And I ll get by Just keep walkin with my head high I ve been up And I ve been down And I ve been beat And pushed around I ll pick myself up off the ground Just wait and see Cause it s just another thing to me Just another bridge I ll have to burn Just another lesson I m bound to learn Buddy ai nt damn thing changin me So watch and see It s just another thing to me I ve been up And I ve been down And I ve been beat And pushed around I ll pick myself up off the ground Just wait and see Cause it s just another thing to me Just another bridge I ll have to burn Just another lesson I m bound to learn Buddy ai nt damn thing changin me So watch and see It s just another thing to me Oh It s just another thing to me
