The Yardbirds,2lxX1ivRYp26soIavdG9bX,Shapes of Things,4wUEyxnu0u0r5Ht2zLI79b, Shapes of things before my eyes Just teach me to despise Will time make man more wise Here within my lonely frame My eyes just hurt my brain But will it seem the same Come tomorrow will I be older Come tomorrow maybe a soldier Come tomorrow will I be bolder than today Now the trees are almost green But will they still be seen When time and tide have been Fall into your passing hands Please do nt destroy these lands Do nt make them desert sands Come tomorrow will I be older Come tomorrow maybe a soldier Come tomorrow will I be bolder than today Soon I hope that I will find Thoughts deep within my mind That wo nt disgrace my kind
