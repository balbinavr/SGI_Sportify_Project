Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,The Man Comes Around,3Jq9rsqmRtqcVKtzP9dnxZ, And I heard as it were the noise of thunder One of the four beasts saying Come and see And I saw and behold a white horse There s a man going around taking names And he decides who to free and who to blame Everybody wo nt be treated all the same There will be a golden ladder reaching down When the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up At the terror in each sip and in each sup Will you partake of that last offered cup Or disappear into the potter s ground When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling and voices crying Some are born and some are dying It s Alpha and Omega s kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It s hard for thee to kick against the pricks Til Armageddon no shalam no shalom Then the father hen will call his chickens home The wise man will bow down before the throne And at his feet they ll cast the golden crowns When the man comes around Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still Listen to the words long written down When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling and voices crying Some are born and some are dying It s Alpha and Omega s kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It s hard for thee to kick against the pricks In measured hundredweight and penny pound When the man comes around And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts And I looked and behold a pale horse And his name that sat on him was Death And Hell followed with him
Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,The Little Drummer Boy,7FIcV2kEiO2mvvMbxU5Jkn, Come they told me our newborn King to see Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the King This is to honor him when we come Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too I have no gift to bring that s fit to give a King But may I play for you on my drum The mother Mary nodded the ox and lamb kept time I played my drum for him I played my best for him Then he smiled at me me and my drum
Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,Highwayman,6uvT4Di9ZRBw5cbexZJDts, Willie Nelson I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive But I am still alive Kris Kristofferson I was a sailor I was born upon the tide And with the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still Waylon Jennings I was a dam builder Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound But I am still around I ll always be around and around and around and around and around Johnny Cash I ll fly a starship Across the Universe divide And when I reach the other side I ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I ll be back again and again and again and again and again
