Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,Hurt,28cnXtME493VX9NOw9cIUh, I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain the only thing that s real The needle tears a hole the old familiar sting Try to kill it all away but I remember everything What have I become my sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair Full of broken thoughts I can not repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here What have I become my sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again a million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,The Man Comes Around,3Jq9rsqmRtqcVKtzP9dnxZ, And I heard as it were the noise of thunder One of the four beasts saying Come and see And I saw and behold a white horse There s a man going around taking names And he decides who to free and who to blame Everybody wo nt be treated all the same There will be a golden ladder reaching down When the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up At the terror in each sip and in each sup Will you partake of that last offered cup Or disappear into the potter s ground When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling and voices crying Some are born and some are dying It s Alpha and Omega s kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It s hard for thee to kick against the pricks Til Armageddon no shalam no shalom Then the father hen will call his chickens home The wise man will bow down before the throne And at his feet they ll cast the golden crowns When the man comes around Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still Listen to the words long written down When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling and voices crying Some are born and some are dying It s Alpha and Omega s kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It s hard for thee to kick against the pricks In measured hundredweight and penny pound When the man comes around And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts And I looked and behold a pale horse And his name that sat on him was Death And Hell followed with him
Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,Highwayman,6uvT4Di9ZRBw5cbexZJDts, Willie Nelson I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive But I am still alive Kris Kristofferson I was a sailor I was born upon the tide And with the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still Waylon Jennings I was a dam builder Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound But I am still around I ll always be around and around and around and around and around Johnny Cash I ll fly a starship Across the Universe divide And when I reach the other side I ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I ll be back again and again and again and again and again
Johnny Cash,6kACVPfCOnqzgfEF5ryl0x,Ain't No Grave,1xADYlM5rjnbJvAW2tc0qF, There ai nt no grave Gon na hold my body down There ai nt no grave Gon na hold my body down When I hear that trumpet sound I m gon na rise up out of the ground Ai nt no grave Gon na hold my body down Well look way down the river And what do you think I see I see a band of angels And they re coming after me Ai nt no grave Can hold my body down There ai nt no grave Can hold my body down Well look down yonder Gabriel Put your feet on the land and sea But Gabriel do nt you blow your trumpet Until you hear from me There ai nt no grave Can hold my body down Ai nt no grave Can hold my body down Well meet me Jesus meet me Meet me in the middle of the air And if these wings do nt fail me I will meet you anywhere Ai nt no grave Can hold my body down There ai nt no grave Can hold my body down Well meet me Mother and Father Meet me down the river road And Mama you know that I ll be there When I check in my load Ai nt no grave Can hold my body down There ai nt no grave Can hold my body down There ai nt no grave Can hold my body down
