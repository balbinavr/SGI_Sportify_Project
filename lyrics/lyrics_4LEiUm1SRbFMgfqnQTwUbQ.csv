Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Skinny Love,2cbic3TiUENlJX91y67ARR, Come on skinny love just last the year Pour a little salt we were never here My my my my my my my my Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer I tell my love to wreck it all Cut out all the ropes and let me fall My my my my my my my my Right in this moment this order s tall And I told you to be patient And I told you to be fine And I told you to be balanced And I told you to be kind And in the morning I ll be with you But it will be a different kind And I ll be holding all the tickets And you ll be owning all the fines Come on skinny love what happened here Suckled on the hope in light brassiere My my my my my my my my Sullen load is full so slow on the split And I told you to be patient And I told you to be fine And I told you to be balanced And I told you to be kind And now all your love is wasted And then who the hell was I And I m breaking at the britches And at the end of all your lines Who will love you Who will fight Who will fall far behind
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Holocene,4fbvXwMTXPWaFyaMWUm9CR, Someway baby it s part of me apart from me You re laying waste to Halloween You fucked it friend it s on it s head it struck the street You re in Milwaukee off your feet And at once I knew I was not magnificent Strayed above the highway aisle Jagged vacance thick with ice For I could see for miles miles miles 3rd and Lake it burnt away the hallway Was where we learned to celebrate The automatic bought the years you d talk for me That night you played me Lit Parade Not the needle nor the thread the lost decree Saying nothing that s enough for me And at once I knew I was not magnificent Hulled far from the highway aisle Jagged vacance thick with ice For I could see for miles miles miles Christmas night it clutched the light The hallow bright Above my brother I and tangled spines We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be Now to know it in my memory And at once I knew I was not magnificent High above the highway aisle Jagged vacance thick with ice For I could see for miles miles miles
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,29 #Strafford APTS,4VZM71F8XAoLRuNyNLxwWS, Sharing smoke In the stair up off the hot car lot Sun shine hard on the video spot Hm mm mm mm Sure as any living dream It s not all then what it seems And the whole thing s hauled away A womb An empty robe Enough You re rolling up You re holding it You re fabric now Paramind Paramind Hallucinating Claire Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns Threw the meaning out the door Now could you be a friend There ai nt no meaning anymore Come and kiss me here again A womb An empty robe Enough You re rolling up You re holding out You re bent prize Canonize Canonize Motor up and yeah you re own ooh And yeah you re on your own Marijuana has you talkin Fold the map and mend the gap And I tow the word companion And I make my self escape Oh the multitude of other It comes always off the page I hold the note You wrote and know You ve buried all your alimony butterflies Sub find Some night
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Re: Stacks,2LthqyP0MLhGUBICwR1535, This my excavation And today is Kumran Everything that happens is from now on This is pouring rain this is paralyzed I keep throwing it down two Hundred at a time It s hard to find it when you knew it When your money s gone and you re drunk as hell On your back with your racks and the stacks as your load In the back and the racks of the stacks are your load In the back with your racks and you re unstacking your load Well I ve been twisting to the sun I needed to replace The fountain in the front yard is rusted out All my love was down in a frozen ground There s a black crow sitting across from me His wiry legs are crossed And he s dangling my keys he even fakes a toss Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load In the back with your racks and you re unstacking your load This is not the sound of a new man Or a crispy realization It s the sound of the unlocking and the lift away Your love will be safe with me
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Blood Bank,7qUoDTmVj07qUf6ZBDhWKl, Well I met you at the blood bank We were looking at the bags Wondering if any of the colors Matched any of the names we knew on the tags You said See look that s yours Stacked on top with your brothers See how they resemble one anothers Even in their plastic little covers And I said I know it well That secret that you know But you do nt know how to tell It fucks with your honor And it teases your head But you know that it s good girl Cause it s running you with red Then the snow started falling We were stuck out in your car You were rubbing both my hands Chewing on a candy bar You said Ai nt this just like the present To be showing up like this As a moon waned to crescent We started to kiss And I said I know it well That secret that we know That we do nt know how to tell I m in love with your honor I m in love with your cheeks What s that noise up the stairs babe Is that Christmas morning creaks And I know it well I know it well I know it well I know it well I know it well I know it well I know it well I know it well
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Beach Baby,7oRNU7Tmek0nm2lqyDojoG, When you re out tell your lucky one To know that you ll leave Do nt you lock when you re fleeing I d like not to hear keys Only hold till your coffee warms But do nt hurry and speed Once a time put a tongue in your ear on the beach And you clutched clinging heels
Bon Iver,4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ,Flume,7xDydFFgyOYit7yAUsRhrI, I am my mother s only one It s enough I wear my garment so it shows Now you know Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she s the moon I am my mother on the wall With us all I move in water shore to shore Nothing s more Only love is all maroon Lapping lakes like leery loons Leaving rope burns reddish ruse Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she s the moon
