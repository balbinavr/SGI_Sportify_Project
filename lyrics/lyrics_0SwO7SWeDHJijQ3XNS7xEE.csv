MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,Kids,1jJci4qxiYcOHhQR247rEU, You were a child crawling on your knees toward it Making mama so proud but your voice is too loud We like to watch you laughing You pick the insects off plants no time to think of consequences Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted The water is warm but it s sending me shivers A baby is born crying out for attention The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror Decision to decisions are made and not bought But I thought this would nt hurt a lot I guess not Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself take only what you need from it A family of trees

MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,Little Dark Age,2Y0iGXY6m6immVb2ktbseM, Breathing in the dark Lying on its side The ruins of the day Painted with a scar And the more I straighten out The less it wants to try The feelings start to rot One wink at a time Oh Forgiving who you are For what you stand to gain Just know that if you hide It does nt go away When you get out of bed Do nt end up stranded Horrified with each stone On the stage My little dark age Picking through the cards Knowing what s nearby The carvings on the face Say they find it hard And the engine s failed again All limits of disguise The humor s not the same Coming from denial Oh I grieve in stereo The stereo sounds strange I know that if you hide It does nt go away If you get out of bed And find me standing all alone Openeyed Burn the page My little dark age I grieve in stereo The stereo sounds strange You know that if it hides It does nt go away If I get out of bed You ll see me standing all alone Horrified On the stage My little dark age Giddy with delight Seeing what s to come The image of the dead Dead ends in my mind Policemen swear to god Love s seeping from the guns I know my friends and I Would probably turn and run If you get out of bed Come find us heading for the bridge Bring a stone All the rage My little dark age I grieve in stereo The stereo sounds strange I know that if you hide It does nt go away If you get out of bed And find me standing all alone Openeyed Burn the page My little dark age All alone Openeyed Burn the page My little dark age
MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,Me and Michael,0t4z0WaQomQqPONghWn8c2, Not everyone can be like me and Michael The only problem is forgetting which side you re on So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights Like all the rest but they ca nt find out In every scene it s me and Michael Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds So it seems the danger signs will never let the feelings die When all the best and brightest have gone Me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It s not a question now It s me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It s not a question now Me and Michael Binary star sink like the setting sun Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come So you think the losing side would never break dividing lines When sanctity was nt a thing of doubt Me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It s not a question now It s me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It s not a question now Me and Michael
MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,Hand It Over,1s2oewEkFG9eF9Mq7MyvCV, The deals we made to shake things up And the rights that they abused Might just fuck us over But the doors wo nt shut Until they re sure there s nothing left to use Someone s taking over Threw it away but now I say It s time to hand it over The joke s worn thin the king stepped in Now we ll see who is who Look who s bending over But the stars were nt wrong the time felt right We both knew it was true The smart ones exit early And the rest hope for a shoulder If we lose our touch it wo nt mean much If everyone s confused Which door do we open It s the same old trick they played their hand Now there s one thing to left to do This time Hand it over It s yours and it s mine Hand it over One thing on my mind Hand it over It s rightfully mine Hand it over In the dark Hand it over What s yours is mine Hand it over Mm make it right Hand it over And give me what s mine Hand it over Oh this time Hand it over It s yours and mine Hand it over Hey it s time to hand it over Just give me what s mine Hand it over Mm anytime Hand it over It s yours and it s mine Hand it over Oh I need time Hand it over No no it s rightfully mine Hand it over Oh anytime
MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,Congratulations,6kblAEj0T0312fv5QWsXzo, Dead in the water It s not a paid vacation The sons and daughters of city officials Attend demonstrations It s hardly a sink or swim When all is well if the ticket sells Out with a whimper It s not a blaze of glory You look down from your temple As people endeavor to make it a story And chisel a marble word But all is lost if it s never heard But I ve got someone to make reports That tell me how my money s spent To book my stays and draw my blinds So I ca nt tell what s really there And all I need s a great big congratulations I ll keep your dreams You pay attention for me As strange as it seems I d rather dissolve than have you ignore me The ground may be moving fast But I tied my boots to a broken mast The difference is clear You throw it in your cauldron Rust and veneer dusk and dawn Steinways and Baldwins You start with a simple stock of all the waste And salt to taste But damn my luck and damn these friends That keep on combing back their smiles I save my grace with halfassed guilt And lay down the quilt upon the lawn Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

MGMT,0SwO7SWeDHJijQ3XNS7xEE,TSLAMP,43rJQjd6zfyTP58TNI9JAi, On my phone Time spent sitting all alone Time spent looking at my phone Time spent sitting all alone Time spent looking at my phone I try to pull the curtains back Turn you off but ca nt detach When all I want and all I know Is time spent looking at my phone On my phone Find me when the lights go down Signing in and signing out Gods descend to take me home Find me staring at my phone I m wondering where the hours went As I m losing consciousness My sullen face is all aglow Time spent looking at my phone Last thing that you need Is the new shiny feature All the memories you ve shared Devoured by perverted creatures Nothing can compete With the first time you saw her Passing strangers on the street Spending every moment looking at their phones On my phone Time spent sitting all alone Time spent looking at my phone Time spent sitting all alone Time spent looking at my phone I call you you do nt call me back Almost had a heart attack I m listening to the window moan Time spent looking at my phone Clouds are getting full So you close all the windows I would never let you die Even if our love is ornamental You know what you need Is a way to remember You can never find the time If you spend everyday looking at your phone You should come with me We can lose ourselves in nothing Copy faces from the feed And then try to turn them into something Even if you choose to believe that it s ending You ll come back to me again You can go ahead and stop pretending Doo doo doo doo doo
