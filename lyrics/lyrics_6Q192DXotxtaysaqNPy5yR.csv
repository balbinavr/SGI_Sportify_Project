Amy Winehouse,6Q192DXotxtaysaqNPy5yR,Tears Dry On Their Own,6yLX8QnxlnEqZfs3YKCfjF, All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew And this regret I got accustomed to Once it was so right when we were at our height Waiting for you in the hotel at night I knew I had nt met my match but every moment we could snatch I do nt know why I got so attached It s my responsibility you do nt owe nothing to me But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I do nt understand why do I stress a man When there s so many bigger things at hand We could ve never had it all we had to hit a wall So this is inevitable withdrawal Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes true I ll be some next man s other woman soon I can not play myself again I should just be my own best friend Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men He walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way in this blue shade My tears dry on their own So we are history your shadow covers me The sky above ablaze He walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets So we are history the shadow covers me The sky above ablaze that only lovers see He walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way in my blue shade My tears dry on their own Whoa he walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way my deep shade My tears dry on their own He walks away the sun goes down He takes the day but I m gone And in your way my deep shade My tears dry
