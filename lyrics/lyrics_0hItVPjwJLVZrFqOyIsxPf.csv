Judy Garland,0hItVPjwJLVZrFqOyIsxPf,Over The Rainbow,4uhTNbfij6C6G2Ecq4Wlia, Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high There s a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true Some day I ll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops That s where you ll find me Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why then oh why ca nt I If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why oh why ca nt I

Judy Garland,0hItVPjwJLVZrFqOyIsxPf,The Trolley Song,1DHwMp0f8HUEpgQtP8yaVq, With my highstarched collar and my hightop shoes And my hair piled high upon my head I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley and lost my heart instead With his light brown derby and his bright green tie He was quite the handsomest of men I started to yen so I counted to ten Then I counted to ten again Clang clang clang went the trolley Ding ding ding went the bell Zing zing zing went my heartstrings From the moment I saw him I fell Chug chug chug went the motor Bump bump bump went the break Thump thump thump went my heartstrings When he smiled I could feel the car shake He tipped his hat and took a seat He said he hoped he had nt stepped upon my feet He asked my name I held my breath I could nt speak because he scared me half to death Buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer Flop flop flop went the wheels Stop stop stop went my heartstrings As he started to go then I started to know How it feels When the Universe reels The day was bright the air was sweet The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet You tried to sing but could nt squeak In fact you loved him so you could nt even speak Buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer Flop flop flop went the wheels Stop stop stop went my heartstrings As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand And as if it were planned He stayed on with me And it was grand just to stand With his hand holding mine To the end of the line
