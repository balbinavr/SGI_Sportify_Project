Brad Paisley,13YmWQJFwgZrd4bf5IjMY4,Whiskey Lullaby,6iblnklMzUKIXAtjk5lzIy, Brad Paisley She put him out like the burnin end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind Until the night Both He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I ll love her til I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby Alison Krauss The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind Until the night Both She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
