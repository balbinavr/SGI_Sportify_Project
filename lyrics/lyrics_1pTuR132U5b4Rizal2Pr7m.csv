Randy Travis,1pTuR132U5b4Rizal2Pr7m,Deeper Than The Holler,3xx0jE52PbtvwXgNaBUdch, Well I ve heard those city singers singin bout how they can love Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above Well I come from the country and I know I ai nt seen it all But I heard that ocean s salty and the stars they sometimes fall And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew My love is deeper than the holler stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill And longer than the song of the whippoorwill From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between There s at least a million love songs that people love to sing And every one is different and every one s the same So this is just another way of sayin the same thing My love is deeper than the holler stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill And longer than the song of the whippoorwill My love is deeper than the holler stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill And longer than the song of the whippoorwill A whippoorwill
