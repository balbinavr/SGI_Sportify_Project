Julia Michaels,0ZED1XzwlLHW4ZaG4lOT6m,There's No Way (feat. Julia Michaels),2hnxrRNzF74mdDzpQZQukQ, You touch me and its almost like we knew That there will be history between us two We knew someday that we would have regrets But we just ignored them the night we met We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered You touch me and its almost like we knew That there will be history Theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other Theres no way that its not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other I wish I could make the time stop So we could forget everything and everyone I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in to what we want Cause when I got somebody you dont And when you got somebody I dont I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in Theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other Theres no way that its not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered You touched me and it s almost like we knew That there would be history Theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other Theres no way that its not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But theres no way that its not going there With the way that were looking at each other We just keep on dancing right into each other We just keep on dancing right into each other
Julia Michaels,0ZED1XzwlLHW4ZaG4lOT6m,Heaven,1T575AhHueYinKSDflEsGK, Ooh ooh Ooh Love s my religion but he was my faith Something so sacred so hard to replace Fallin for him was like fallin from grace All wrapped in one he was so many sins Would have done anything everything for him And if you ask me I would do it again No need to imagine cause I know it s true They say all good boys go to heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you It s automatic it s just what they do They say all good boys go to Heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you You do nt realise the power they have Until they leave you and you want them back Nothing in this world prepares you for that I m not ashamed that he was nt the one Had no idea what we would become There s no regrets I just thought it was fun No need to imagine cause I know it s true They say all good boys go to heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you It s automatic it s just what they do They say all good boys go to Heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you I still remember the moment we met The touch that he planted the garden he left I guess the rain was just half that effect No need to imagine cause I know it s true They say all good boys go to heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you It s automatic it s just what they do They say all good boys go to Heaven But bad boys bring Heaven to you Ooh ooh Ooh
