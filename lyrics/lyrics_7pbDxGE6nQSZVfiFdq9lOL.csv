Rex Orange County,7pbDxGE6nQSZVfiFdq9lOL,Sunflower,4EpZ4eYuZOwPSSwyqpdHnJ, I want to know Where I can go When you re not around And I m feeling down So wo nt you stay for a moment So I can say I I need you so Cause right now you know that nothing here s new And I m obsessed with you Then I fell to the ground And you smiled at me and said I do nt wan na see you cry You do nt have to feel this emptiness She said I love you till the day that I die Well maybe she s right Cause I do nt wan na feel like I m not me And to be honest I do nt even know why I let myself get down in the first place Tryna keep my mind at bay Sunflowers still grows at night Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes Make it down down dododown Diggy dig down du du du du Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream A dream of you and I There s no need to keep an open eye I promise I m the one for you Just let me hold you in these arms tonight I m lucky to be me and you can see it in my face Back when I fucked my shit up too many times Why would I let myself get down in the first place Tryna keep my mind at bay Sunflowers still grows at night Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes Make it down down dododown Diggy dig down du du du Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes And so she sat me down and told me that I did nt have to cry Said I did nt need to get down and feel empty inside And told me that she love me for as long as she s alive And well maybe she s right cause I hate it when I feel like I m not me See I honestly do nt even know why I I honestly do nt even know why Tryna keep my mind at bay Sunflowers still grows at night Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes Make it down down dododown Diggy dig down du du du Waiting for a minute till the sun s seen through my eyes
