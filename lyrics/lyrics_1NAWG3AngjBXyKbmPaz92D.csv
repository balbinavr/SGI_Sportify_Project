Sammy Davis Jr.,1NAWG3AngjBXyKbmPaz92D,Something's Gotta Give,3krgfOQI9Szq8cF0Umm1O1, When an irresistible force Such as you Meets an old immovable object like me You can bet as sure as you live Something s got ta give Something s got ta give Something s got ta give When an irrepressible smile Such as yours Warms an old implacable heart Such as mine Do nt say no Because I insist Somewhere somehow someone s gon na be kissed So on guard Who knows what the fates have in store From their vast mysterious sky I ll try hard ignoring those lips I adore But how long can anyone try Fight fight fight fight Fight it with all of our might Chances are some heavenly starspangled night You ll find out As sure as we live Something s really got to give
