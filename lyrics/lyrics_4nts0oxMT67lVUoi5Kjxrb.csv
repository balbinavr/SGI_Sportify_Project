Solomon Burke,4nts0oxMT67lVUoi5Kjxrb,Flesh And Blood,5eXEWqDoP6RgnlOQgti12v, Come sit beside me That ll do for now The night has come and left me Just the light that you allow Come speak my name Fill my head with all such foolish dreams My flesh and blood Is no more real to me Than what it seems My love for you is burning Like a spark along a fuse I feel your mark upon me now As surely as the hand that leaves the bruise Life is for the living And life comes hard for some The rest of us with flesh and blood Make it hard all along All I ever wanted Was the freedom to refuse Or something of my own to love enough To hate To lose The fever in my brain Is leaving smoke behind my eyes But the part of me that wants to change Fights the part of me that trys Come see the golden light Cause I ve turned the gold light on Sometimes god knows You got ta learn to shine shine shine shine shine gold I stepped out of darkness And for a moment I m only living by your kiss your kiss your kiss your kiss your Lips your kiss And now just for now our flesh and blood Is more real than this More real than this
Solomon Burke,4nts0oxMT67lVUoi5Kjxrb,Diamond In Your Mind,0LzKSYLuYZ4v30iEqcmC9J, I shook the hand of the president and the pope in Rome I ve been to parties where I ve had to be flown They said everything was sacred nothing was profane And money was something that you throw off the back of trains Oh always keep a diamond in your mind You got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Wherever you may wander Wherever you may roam You got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Steam of the gravy with little fried pearls Floating like a necklace on a beautiful girl Johan says thanks to the food and land And oh so ever grateful for God s on my hands Oh always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Wherever you may wander Wherever you may roam You got ta always keep a diamond in your mind She s got the milk of human kindness and the fat of the lamb Scared like a baby well she drives like a man She lives outside of Natchez where she operates a crane She s like a wrecking ball no longer connected to the chain Oh Zerelda Samuel said she almost never prayed Said she lost her right arm blown off in a Pinkerton raid Then they lashed her to a windmill with old 3fingered Dave Now she s 102 drinking mint juleps in the shade Everybody always keep a diamond in your mind You got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Wherever you may wander Wherever you may roam Your got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Wherever you may wander Wherever you may roam Your got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Wherever you may wander Wherever you may roam Your got ta always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind Always keep a diamond in your mind
Solomon Burke,4nts0oxMT67lVUoi5Kjxrb,Only A Dream,5Einzxx7I1BC5iFWgqv91X, Only a dream That I had In the night Only a dream But it felt So right Well I was down there In the moonlight I was holding you tight But it was only a dream Only a dream Only a dream That knocks me off my feet Only a dream Have you dancing In the street And that big band Keeps on playing Joe henry s retreat But only a dream Only in my dream Only a dream But somebody tried to knock me down Only a dream Keeps on hanging around Only a dream We re rolling in the snow Only a dream We just could nt let go I sit outside your window Just like romeo But it s only a dream Yes only a dream But someone tries to knock me down To the ground But it was only a dream But it s just a dream Still hanging around
