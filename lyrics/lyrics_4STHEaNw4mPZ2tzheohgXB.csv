Paul McCartney,4STHEaNw4mPZ2tzheohgXB,Band On The Run - Remastered 2010,1H4idkmruFoJBg1DvUv2tY, Stuck inside these four walls Sent inside forever Never seeing no one nice again Like you mama You mama You If I ever get out of here Thought of giving it all away To a registered charity All I need is a pint a day If I ever get out of here If we ever get out of here Well the rain exploded with a mighty crash As we fell into the sun And the first one said to the second one there I hope you re having fun Band on the run Band on the run And the jailer man and Sailor Sam Were searching everyone For the band on the run Band on the run For the band on the run Band on the run Well the undertaker drew a heavy sigh Seeing no one else had come And a bell was ringing in the Village Square For the rabbits on the run Band on the run Band on the run And the jailer man and Sailor Sam Were searching everyone For the band on the run Band on the run Yeah the band on the run Band on the run Band on the run Band on the run Well the night was falling as the desert world Began to settle down In the town they re searching for us everywhere But we never will be found Band on the run Band on the run And the County Judge who held a grudge Will search forevermore For the band on the run Band on the run Band on the run Band on the run
