Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski),572R9OVMyWKBeg1hOMgSsW, Her parents never took the young girl to church Never spoke of His Name Never read her His Word Two nonbelievers walkin lost in this world Took their baby with them what a sad little girl Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs She d watch the TV and sit there on the couch While her Mom fell asleep and her Daddy went out And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night Behind their couch she d be hiding oh what a sad little life And like it always does the bad just got worse With every slap and every curse Until her Daddy in a drunken rage one night Used a gun on her Mom and then took his life And some people from the city took the girl far away To a new Mom and a new Dad Kisses and hugs everyday Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him She said I know that man there on that cross I do nt know His name but I know He got off Cause He was there in my old house And held me close to His side As I hid there behind our couch The night that my parents died
