Kacey Musgraves,70kkdajctXSbqSMJbQO424,Slow Burn,6ET9kf9riLETWs9lePUEAI, Born in a hurry always late Have nt been early since 88 Texas is hot I can be cold Grandma cried when I pierced my nose Good in a glass good on green Good when you re putting your hands all over me I m alright with a slow burn Taking my time let the world turn I m gon na do it my way it ll be alright If we burn it down and it takes all night It s a slow burn yeah In Tennessee the sun s goin down But in Beijing they re heading out to work You know the bar down the street do nt close for an hour We should take a walk and look at all the flowers Cause I m alright with a slow burn Taking my time let the world turn I m gon na do it my way it ll be alright If we burn it down and it takes all night It s a slow burn Whatever feels good Old soul waiting my turn I know a few things but I still got a lot to learn So I m alright with a slow burn slow burn slow burn I m alright with a slow burn
