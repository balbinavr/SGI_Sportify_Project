Tame Impala,5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb,The Less I Know The Better,6K4t31amVTZDgR3sKmwUJJ, Someone said they left together I ran out the door to get her She was holding hands with Trevor Not the greatest feeling ever Said Pull yourself together You should try your luck with Heather Then I heard they slept together Oh the less I know the better The less I know the better Oh my love ca nt you see yourself by my side No surprise when you re on his shoulder like every night Oh my love ca nt you see that you re on my mind Do nt suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind So goodbye She said It s not now or never Wait ten years we ll be together I said Better late than never Just do nt make me wait forever Do nt make me wait forever Do nt make me wait forever Oh my love ca nt you see yourself by my side I do nt suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind I was doing fine without you Till I saw your face now I ca nt erase Giving in to all this bullshit Is this what you want is this who you are I was doing fine without you Till I saw your eyes turn away from mine Oh sweet darling where he wants you Said Come on Superman say your stupid line Said Come on Superman say your stupid line Said Come on Superman say your stupid line
Tame Impala,5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb,Let It Happen,2X485T9Z5Ly0xyaghN73ed, It s always around me all this noise But not nearly as loud as the voice Saying Let it happen let it happen it s gon na feel so good Just let it happen let it happen All this running around Trying to cover my shadow A notion growing inside And all the others seem shallow All this running around Bearing down on my shoulders I can hear an alarm Must be morning I heard about a whirlwind that s coming round It s gon na carry off all that is nt bound And when it happens when it happens I wo nt be holding on So let it happen let it happen All this running around I ca nt fight it much longer Something s trying to get out And it s never been closer If my takeoff fails Make up some other story But if I never come back Tell my mother I m sorry I will not vanish and you will not scare me Try to get through it try to bounce to it You are not thinking that I will not do it They be lovin someone and I m not stupid Take the next ticket to take the next train Why would I do it and you wan na think that I will not vanish and you will not scare me Try to get through it try to bounce to it You are not thinking that I will not do it They be lovin someone and I m not stupid Take the next ticket to take the next train Why would I do it and you wan na think that I will not vanish and you will not scare me Try to get through it try to bounce to it You are not thinking that I will not do it They be lovin someone and I m not stupid Take the next ticket to take the next train Why would I do it and you wan na think that Baby now I m already moving on Oh but maybe I was ready all along Oh I m ready for this moment and the sound Oh but maybe I was ready all along Oh baby now I m already moving on Oh but maybe I was ready all along Oh I m ready for this moment and the sound Oh but maybe I was ready all along

Tame Impala,5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb,Elephant,6qZjm61s6u8Ead9sWxCDro, Well he feels like an elephant Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it He knows that you re dreaming about being loved by him Too bad your chances are slim And it s not like Mister Shook To get shy when they ask him who is under There must be something deep down in the dark down there He s not too easily scared He s got friends but they got the fear Would nt care too much if he just disappeared Oh look hey there he is now coming down the stairs Here it comes He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac yeah Cause he does nt like it looking like he looks back He talks like his opinion is a simple fact Somebody grabbed his collar He cried the whole way home Nobody remembered a thing when they saw him again That s how it is til the end yeah
