Sam Hunt,2kucQ9jQwuD8jWdtR9Ef38,Body Like A Back Road,7mldq42yDuxiUNn08nvzHO, Got a girl from the south side got braids in her hair First time I seen her walk by man I bout fell off my chair Had to get her number it took me like six weeks Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin 15 in a 30 I ai nt in no hurry Ima take it slow just as fast as I can The way she fit in them blue jeans she do nt need no belt But I can turn them inside out I do nt need no help Got hips like honey so thick and so sweet It ai nt no curves like hers on them downtown streets Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin 15 in a 30 I ai nt in no hurry Ima take it slow just as fast as I can We re out here in the boondocks With the breeze and the birds Tangled up in the tall grass With my lips on hers On the highway to heaven Headed south of her smile Get there when we get there Every inch is a mile Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin 15 in a 30 I ai nt in no hurry Ima take it slow just as fast as I can Ima take it slow Just as fast as I can Body like a back road Drivin with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand
