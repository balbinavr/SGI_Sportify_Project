The Wood Brothers,6FxuPrpa8phaP3Xn73emhT,Luckiest Man,26uHwSHlaK5mskSMhbRod3, My whole Saturday and Sunday too I was thinking about ways not to lose I lay down my weapons is what I ve done Too late to hide feet too soft to run But people say I m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You re not gon na win but still you re the luckiest man you re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you do nt know is you are the luckiest man You re the luckiest man I done talked to the devil when he calls my name But sometimes when I m losing it all seems the same And when I fall I m back up again Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in But people say I m the luckiest man Yeah they say Running is useless and fighting is foolish You re not gon na win but still you re the luckiest man you re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you do nt know is you are the luckiest man You re the luckiest man Try to keep my faith and keep my mind Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind And I ca nt help but mourning just a little each night People say everything is gon na be all right They say I m the luckiest man Yeah they say That running is useless and fighting is foolish You re not gon na win but still you re the luckiest man you re up against And too many horses and mysterious forces What you do nt know is you are the luckiest man You re the luckiest man You re the luckiest man
