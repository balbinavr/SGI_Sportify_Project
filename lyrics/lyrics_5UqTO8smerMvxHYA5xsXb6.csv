Sonic Youth,5UqTO8smerMvxHYA5xsXb6,Teen Age Riot (Album Version),0WIbzDVEpmOyBnqqdtqIL9, You re it no you re it Yeah you re really it you re it No I mean it you re it Say it do nt spray it Spirit desire face me Spirit desire do nt displace me Spirit desire we will fall Miss me do nt dismiss me Spirit desire Spirit desire spirit desire Spirit desire we will fall Spirit desire we will fall Spirit desire spirit desire Spirit desire we will fall Spirit desire we will fall Everybody s talking bout the stormy weather and what s a man to do but work out whether it s true Looking for a man with a focus and a temper who can open up a map and see between one and two Time to get it before you let it get to you Here he comes now Stick to your guns and let him through Everybody s coming from the winter vacation taking in the sun in a exaltation to you You come running in on platform shoes with Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue Ah here it comes I know it s someone I knew Teenage riot in a public station gon na fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you Now I see it I think I ll leave it out of the way Now I come near you and it s not clear why you fade away Looking for a ride to your secret location where the kids are setting up a freespeed nation for you Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that s rocking and a cord and a pedal and a lock that ll do me for now It better work out I hope it works out my way Cause it s getting kind of quiet in my city head takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now You better look it we re gon na shake it up to him He acts the hero we paint a zero on his hand We know it s down We know it s bound too loose Everybody s sound is around it everybody wants to be proud to choose So who s to take the blame for the stormy weather you re never gon na stop all the teenage leather and booze It s time to go round A one man showdown teach us how to fail We re off the streets now and back on the road on the riot trail
