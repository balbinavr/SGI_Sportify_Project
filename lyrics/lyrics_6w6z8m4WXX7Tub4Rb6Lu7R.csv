Jethro Tull,6w6z8m4WXX7Tub4Rb6Lu7R,Aqualung,5UuikgHTxSRFRnC0zXx10i, Sitting on the park bench Eyeing little girls with bad intent yeah Snot running down his nose Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes Hey Aqualung Drying in the cold sun Watching as the frilly panties run Hey Aqualung Feeling like a dead duck Spitting out pieces of his broken luck Oh Aqualung Sun streaking cold An old man wandering lonely Taking time the only way he knows Leg hurtin bad As he bends to pick a dogend He goes down to the bog and warms his feet Feeling alone The army s up the road Salvation la mode and a cup of tea Aqualung my friend Do nt you start away uneasy You poor old sod you see it s only me Yeah Do you still remember December s foggy freeze When the ice that clings onto your beard Was screaming agony Hey And you snatch your rattling last breaths With deepsea diver sounds And the flowers bloom like Madness in the spring Sun streaking cold An old man wandering lonely Taking time the only way he knows Leg hurting bad As he bends to pick a dogend He goes down to the bog and warms his feet Feeling alone The army s up the road Salvation la mode and a cup of tea Aqualung my friend Do nt you start away uneasy You poor old sod you see it s only me Aqualung my friend Do nt you start away uneasy You poor old sod you see it s only me yeah Sitting on the park bench Eyeing little girls with bad intent yeah Snot running down his nose Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes Hey Aqualung Drying in the cold sun Watching as the frilly panties run Hey Aqualung Feeling like a dead duck Spitting out pieces of his broken luck Hey Aqualung Whoa Aqualung
Jethro Tull,6w6z8m4WXX7Tub4Rb6Lu7R,Locomotive Breath,0MYNeFsKpzBHwrJGfWZysV, In the shuffling madness of the locomotive breath Runs the alltime loser headlong to his death Oh he feels the pistons scraping Steam breaking on his brow Old Charlie stole the handle And the train it wo nt stop going No way to slow down He sees his children jumpin off at stations one by one His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun Oh he s crawling down the corridor On his hands and knees Old Charlie stole the handle And the train it wo nt stop going No way to slow down He hears the silence howling catches angels as they fall And the all time winner has got him by the balls Oh he picks up Gideon s Bible Open at page one I thank God he stole the handle And the train it wo nt stop going No way to slow down No way to slow down No way to slow down No way to slow down No way to slow down No way to slow down No way to slow down
Jethro Tull,6w6z8m4WXX7Tub4Rb6Lu7R,Cross Eyed Mary,6MBZyLisOWTChcevgFqwVr, Who would be a poor man a beggarman a thief If he had a rich man in his hand And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby s mouth If he could take it from the money man Crosseyed Mary goes jumping in again She signs no contract but she always plays the game She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel And the jackknife barber drops her off at school Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys Would rather make it with a letching grey Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung Who watches through the railings as they play Crosseyed Mary finds it hard to get along She s a poor man s rich girl and she ll do it for a song She s a rich man stealer but her favour s good and strong She s the Robin Hood of Highgate helps the poor man get along Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys Would rather make it with a letching grey Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung Who watches through the railings as they play Crosseyed Mary goes jumping in again She signs no contract but she always plays the game She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel And the jackknife barber drops her off at school Crosseyed Mary Oh Mary Oh crosseyed Mary

Jethro Tull,6w6z8m4WXX7Tub4Rb6Lu7R,Thick As A Brick - Edit No 1; 2001 Remastered Version,3jBCv3pVTXV7VYR4FhZkc7, Really do nt mind if you sit this one out My words but a whisper your deafness a SHOUT I may make you feel but I ca nt make you think Your sperm s in the gutter your love s in the sink So you ride yourselves over the fields and You make all your animal deals and Your wise men do nt know how it feels to be thick as a brick And the sandcastle virtues are all swept away in The tidal destruction The moral melee The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers The newfangled way But your new shoes are worn at the heels and Your suntan does rapidly peel and Your wise men do nt know how it feels to be thick as a brick And the love that I feel is so far away I m a bad dream that I just had today and you Shake your head and Say it s a shame Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth Spin me down the long ages let them sing the song
