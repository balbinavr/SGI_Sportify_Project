Waylon Jennings,7wCjDgV6nqBsHguQXPAaIM,Highwayman,6uvT4Di9ZRBw5cbexZJDts, Willie Nelson I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twentyfive But I am still alive Kris Kristofferson I was a sailor I was born upon the tide And with the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still Waylon Jennings I was a dam builder Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound But I am still around I ll always be around and around and around and around and around Johnny Cash I ll fly a starship Across the Universe divide And when I reach the other side I ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I ll be back again and again and again and again and again
