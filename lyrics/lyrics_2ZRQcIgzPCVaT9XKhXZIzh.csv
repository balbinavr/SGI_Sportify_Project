Daya),0Ev562zA4pmUsBqjxsxxdx, Yeah I doubt I doubt myself And I m too proud to ask for help When you see me beside myself I do nt have to explain it baby Yeah I m over picking fights And trying to mend it with the high Do nt wan na know that I m not right I know that I ve been lately lately Yeah sometimes I need someone to pick me up Overdose my mind with the things I love You can take me there When my heart beats when my heart beats free Take my hand in the middle of a crisis Pull me close show me baby where the light is I was scared of a heart I could nt silence But you make me you make me feel good I like it Take my hand in the middle of a crisis Pull me close show me baby where the light is I was scared of a heart I could nt silence But you make me you make me feel good I like it But you make me you make me feel good Yeah I get overoverwhelmed When all these problems burn like hell Maybe I just need a friend Who never calls me crazy crazy You pull me off the front line before I run Keep me cool when I get overdone You can take me there When my heart speaks when my heart speaks free Take my hand in the middle of a crisis Pull me close show me baby where the light is I was scared of a heart I could nt silence But you make me you make me feel good I like it Take my hand in the middle of a crisis Pull me close show me baby where the light is I was scared of a heart I could nt silence But you make me you make me feel good I like it But you make me you make me feel good I like it I like it You make me you make me feel good Taking the weights off To help with the pressure And I was here stressing Thinking it mattered Been with you for hours but it feels like seconds It s only moments and I m in heaven It s only moments and I m in heaven oh You make me feel good You make me feel good You make me you make me feel good I like it Take my hand in the middle of a crisis Pull me close show me baby where the light is I was scared of a heart I could nt silence But you make me you make me feel good I like it Nananananana oooh Nananananana
