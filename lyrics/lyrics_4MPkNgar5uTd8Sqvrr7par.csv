Clay Walker,4MPkNgar5uTd8Sqvrr7par,Fore She Was Mama,3AfCiIJ6blcN5oyMnu3Tvi, Bout ten years old hide and seek I found me in the closet Ready or not I stumbled on And opened up that box of Yearbooks letters black and whites A hundred maybe more Next thing I know my brothers and me Got em scattered on the floor Yeah There was one of her flippin the bird Sittin on a Harley And a few with some hairy hippie dude Turns out his name was Charlie Her hair her clothes her drinkin smokin Had us boys confused I ll never forget the day us nosey kids got introduced To Mama fore she was Mama In a string bikini in Tijuana Wo nt admit she smoked marijuana But I saw Mama fore she was Mama We put that box right where it was And never said a word But growin up got hard just tryin Not to picture her In anything but aprons dresses Minivans and church Oh and Daddy would have whooped our butts For diggin up that dirt On Mama fore she was Mama In a string bikini in Tijuana She wo nt admit she smoked marijuana But I saw Mama fore she was Mama We laugh and hang it over her head Right above her halo Her face turns red when we bring up That tiedyed Winnebago She runs and hides and still denies That hip high rose tattoo She burned that box of forgetmenots When she found out we knew About Mama fore she was Mama In a string bikini in Tijuana Wo nt admit she smoked marijuana But that was Mama fore she was Mama And there s that one down in the Bahamas But that was Mama fore she was Mama

Clay Walker,4MPkNgar5uTd8Sqvrr7par,This Woman And This Man,5sp0v1NDTtfzcPMtFotz80, Been trying so hard just to talk to you Have nt heard half of what you want me to I hurt so bad over where we ve been Do nt know how not to go back there again I know what I want to say Can I get it through to you now In some other way Like there was this woman and there was this man There was this moment they had a chance To hold on to what they had How could they be so in love and still never see Now nothing could be sadder than this woman This woman and this man A strangers eyes in a lovers face See no signs of a better time and place Have we lost the key to an open door I feel the need to reach out to you even more It s a circle we re going round If we do nt get us out from under it s going to take us down Like there was this woman and there was this man There was this moment they had a chance To hold on to what they had How could they be so in love and still never see Now nothing could be sadder than this woman This woman and this man For all we ve got to lose so much to gain If we come this far and leave it behind There s only you and me to blame There was this woman and there was this man There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had How can they be so in love and still never see How they can get it back again This woman and this man
