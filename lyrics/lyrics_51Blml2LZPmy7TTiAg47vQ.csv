U2,51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ,Beautiful Day,1VuBmEauSZywQVtqbxNqka, The heart is a bloom Shoots up through the stony ground There s no room No space to rent in this town You re out of luck And the reason that you had to care The traffic is stuck And you re not moving anywhere You thought you d found a friend To take you out of this place Someone you could lend a hand In return for grace It s a beautiful day The sky falls and you feel like It s a beautiful day Do nt let it get away You re on the road But you ve got no destination You re in the mud In the maze of her imagination You love this town Even if that does nt ring true You ve been all over And it s been all over you It s a beautiful day Do nt let it get away It s a beautiful day Oh Touch me Take me to that other place Teach me I know I m not a hopeless case See the world in green and blue See China right in front of you See the canyons broken by cloud See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out See the Bedouin fires at night See the oil fields at first light and See the bird with a leaf in her mouth After the flood all the colours came out It was a beautiful day Do nt let it get away Beautiful day Touch me Take me to that other place Reach me I know I m not a hopeless case What you do nt have you do nt need it now What you do nt know you can feel it somehow What you do nt have you do nt need it now Do nt need it now It s a beautiful day
