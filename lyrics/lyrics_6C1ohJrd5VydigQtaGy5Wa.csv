Joyner Lucas,6C1ohJrd5VydigQtaGy5Wa,I'm Sorry,3dqxngWDgh4tb0VSb83nvc, Go ahead and call me a coward And say that I m not strong because I m not like you Go ahead and call me crazy Cause I live in a maze tell me how about you I think I live in my head Sometimes I think that I m dead I hide behind my youth Know I been losing my mind And I m a little behind step inside my shoes Cause I ve never been happy with myself And I do nt need no one feeling bad for me Trying to offer me pity and throw jabs at me Wan na give me advice and then laugh at me Behind closed doors just close the door Let me be by myself just me and myself I m tired of living I cry I hear it s easy to die I wan na see for myself And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else But I m depressed as fuck stressed as fuck Ai nt no medicine that could cure what s the test as drugs I mean I need extra love And that ai nt even enough said that ai nt even enough And where the fuck is God God God Damn maybe I ai nt believing enough But today we gon na see if He s real And if He is then I guess I m prolly going to hell Look I ai nt wan na die like this I ai nt picture my life like this They do nt know what it s like like this Pretending I m happy so I can smile like this and laugh like you Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like woo Or would you feel lost without me Cause honestly I think the world is better off without me And my mind s spinning this is the line finish Truth is I do nt care how they feel about my feelings I made up my mind I m going out like Robin Williams I guess I m not the Ordinary People of John Legend And I ve been suicidal since the day I was nine shit Okay the day I was nine I ve been tired of being bullied could nt stay out the fire Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time And dammit look at me now fuck Fuck pen runnin out shit fu ugh Look just know it s a new day But if you reading this then it s probably too late

weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family it s okay I m sorry But it s too late I m sorry too much weighing on me I do nt wan na live to see another day I m sorry But I ca nt stay I m sorry too much weighing on me I hope you got what you wanted I hope you finally happy it s too late for you Been going out of my mind You do nt know how many times that I done prayed for you I hope you hear me goddammit Cause I got so much shit that I wan na say to you I used to shine now I m all in the dark I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart But goddammit look at you now it s all of your fault How could you Maybe it s my fault I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin Maybe I should have been more of an influence I ca nt believe that you re dead I fu I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it But I ll forever be attached to you damn Part of me feels bad for you A part of me feels like you weak and I m mad at you And I do nt mean to be insensitive But I do nt understand how we could nt prevent this shit You took the easy way out goddammit you did I mean look what you did I m so fucking upset How could you be so selfish Nigga how could you be so selfish Now you re gone you done left me so helpless I wonder what God thinks I hope you in God s place Behaving yourself Yo what the fuck you got ta say for yourself say for yourself Look I really feel lost without you I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you And my mind s spinning this is the line finish Truth is I do nt care how you feel about my feelings And I d be lying to you if I told you I m fine listen I know that you can hear me all I need is like five minutes I just wan na reach inside the casket and pull you out I m sorry this is something that we both could nt figure out I wish I could hear you now is your soul missing I wonder if you could do it again would you do it different Tell me what death is like Was it meant for you Brodie Did the heaven support it Are you fucking happy now Did you get what you wanted Is nt this what you wanted I feel the temperature falling And you ve been suicidal back then you were nine Yeah even back then you was nine We was living on the edge could nt stay out the fire Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time And damn it look at you now shit But it s a new day And if you ca nt hear me it s probably too late fuck Just make sure you tell my family it s okay I m sorry But it s too late I m sorry too much weighing on me I do nt wan na live to see another day I m sorry But I ca nt stay I m sorry too much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family it s okay I m sorry But it s too late I m sorry too much weighing on me I do nt wan na live to see another day I m sorry But I ca nt stay I m sorry too much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family it s okay I m sorry But it s too late I m sorry too much weighing on me I do nt wan na live to see another day I m sorry But I ca nt stay I m sorry too much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family it s okay I m sorry But it s too late I m sorry too much weighing on me I do nt wan na live to see another day I m sorry But I ca nt stay I m sorry too much weighing on me
Joyner Lucas,6C1ohJrd5VydigQtaGy5Wa,I'm Not Racist,0hL8yBivUahlm1rhQ1a0Xx, With all due respect I do nt have pity for you black niggas that s the way I feel Screamin Black Lives Matter All the black guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills Yellin nigga this and nigga that Call everybody nigga and get a nigga mad As soon as I say nigga then everyone react And wan na swing at me and call me racist cause I ai nt black Well pound that then Talkin about slavery like you was around back then Like you was pickin cotton off the fuckin ground back then Like you was on the plantation gettin down back then Aight look I see a black man aimin his gun But I d rather see a black man claimin his son And I do nt mean just for one day and you done I mean you still trapped in a rut And I work my ass off and I pay my taxes for what So you can keep livin off free government assistance Food stamps for your children but you re still tryna sell em For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin babysitter While you party on the road cause you ai nt got no fuckin goals You already late You motherfuckas needa get your damn priorities straight Wait it s like you re proud to be fake But you lazy as fuck and you d rather sell drugs Than get a job and be straight And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate Fuck outta my face You ca nt escape problems You can pray for some change but ca nt break a dollar Got nobody else to blame so you blame Donald They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom My voice been back I m not racist my sister s boyfriend s black I m not racist my sisterinlaw s baby cousin Tracy Got a brother and his girlfriend s black My head s in the cloud Heard there s not enough jobs for all the men in your house Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out Or maybe we should send em all to the ghetto for now I m not racist and I never lie But I think there s a disconnect between your culture and mine I worship the Einsteins study the Steve Jobs But you ride 2Pac s dick like he was a fuckin god oh my God And all you care about is rappin And stuntin and bein ratchet and that s the nigga within you Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues Blame it all on the menu blame it on those drinks Blame it on everybody except for your own race Blame it on white privileges blame it on white kids And just blame it on white citizens same with the vice president Bunch of class clowns Niggas kneelin on the field that s a flag down How dare you try to make demands for this money You gon show us some respect you gon stand for this country nigger I m not racist I m just prepared for this type of war I heard Eminem s rap at the awards who s he fightin for Yall can take that motherfucker too he ai nt white no more It s like you wan na be so famous You ll do anything for attention and a little payment I ca nt take you nowhere without people pointin fingers Pants hangin off your ass you ai nt got no home trainin Put your fuckin pants up nigga put that suit back on Take that durag off take that gold out your mouth Quit the pitiful stuff And then maybe police would stop killin you fucks yo what the fuck I m not racist It s like we livin in the same buildin but split into two floors I m not racist But there s two sides to every story I wish that I knew yours I wish that I knew yours I m not racist I swear With all disrespect I do nt really like you white motherfuckers that s just where I m at Screaming All Lives Matter Is a protest to my protest what kind of shit is that And that s one war you ll never win The power in the word nigga is a different sin We should nt say it but we do and that just what it is But that do nt mean that you can say it just cause you got nigga friends Nigga That word was originated for you to keep us under And when we use it we know that s just how we greet each other And when you use it we know there s a double meaning under And even if I was nt picking cotton physically That do nt mean I m not affected by the history My grandmama was a slave that shit gets to me And you ai nt got no motherfucking sympathy you pussy nigga I m sorry you can never feel my life Tryna have faith but I never felt alright It s hard to elevate when this country s ran by whites Judging me by my skin color and my blackness Tryna find a job but ai nt nobody call me back yet Now I got ta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet You crackers ai nt slick this is all a part of your tactics Do nt talk about no motherfucking taxes when I ai nt making no dough You think you know everything but you dont You wan na copy our slang and everything that we know Try to steal black culture and then make it your own whoa Fuck I m exhausted I ca nt even drive without the cops tryna start shit I m tired of the systematic racism bullshit All you do is false shit this the shit that I m force fed And you do nt know shit about my people that s what bothers you You do nt know about no fried chicken and no barbeque You do nt know about the twostep or no loose change You do nt know about no 2 Chainz or no KoolAid you do nt know And even though Barack was half as black You hated president Obama I know that s a fact You could nt wait to get him out and put a cracker back And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it s payback for that I m not racist I never lied But I know there s a disconnect between your culture and mine Yeah I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin god He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin died nigga die nigga And all you care about is money and power And being ugly and that s the cracker within you Hatred all in your brain it slowly start to convince you And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue Blame it on Puerto Rico blame it on OJ Blame it on everybody except for your own race Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens Aim at the black businesses I ai nt saying I m innocent But I might be any day now Treatin everybody how you want and any way how I swear North Korea bout to bomb us any day now And now I m duckin every time I hear a fuckin plane now shit You know I make a lot of sense but you just ca nt admit it When Eminem went against Trump that was the illest Cause even though he s white he let us know he standin with us I m not racist but I cry a lot You do nt know what it s like to be in a frying pot You do nt know what it s like to mind your business And get stopped by the cops and not know if you bout to die or not You worry bout your life so you take mine I love you but I fuckin hate you at the same time I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives So we could understand each other more but that d take time I m not racist It s like we livin in the same buildin but splittin the both sides I m not racist But there s two sides to every story and now you know mine Ca nt erase the scars with a bandage I m hopin maybe we can come to an
