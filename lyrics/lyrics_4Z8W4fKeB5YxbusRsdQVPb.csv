Radiohead,4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb,Jigsaw Falling Into Place,15ea10YpJIl3mJq75yzqsD, Just as you take my hand Just as you write my number down Just as the drinks arrive Just as they play your favorite song As your bad day disappears No longer wound up like a spring Before you ve had too much Come back in focus again The walls are bending shape They got a cheshire cat grin All blurring into one This place is on a mission Before the night owl Before the animal noises Closed circuit cameras Before you re comatose Before you run away from me Before you re lost between the notes The beat goes round and round The beat goes round and round I never really got there I just pretended that I had Words are blunt instruments Words are sawed off shotguns Come on and let it out Come on and let it out Come on and let it out Come on and let it out Before you run away from me Before you re lost between the notes Just as you take the mic Just as you dance dance dance A jigsaw falling into place So there is nothing to explain You eye each other as you pass She looks back and you look back Not just once And not just twice Wish away your nightmare Wish away the nightmare You got a light you can feel it on your back A light and you can feel it on your back Your jigsaw falling into place
