Cannonball Adderley,5v74mT11KGJqadf9sLw4dA,The Masquerade Is Over,1jf3wYtynxiPOdhqAp3cUN, Your eyes do nt shine like they used to shine And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine I m afraid the masquerade is over And so is love and so is love Your words do nt mean what they used to mean They were once inspired now they re just routine I m afraid the masquerade is over And so is love and so is love I guess I ll have to play Pagliacci And get myself a clown s disguise And then I ll learn to laugh like Pagliacci With tears in my eyes You look you look the same you re a lot the same But my heart says No no you re not the same I m afraid the masquerade is over all over And so is love and so is love It s all over and so is love
