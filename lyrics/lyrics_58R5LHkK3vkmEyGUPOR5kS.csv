KONGOS,58R5LHkK3vkmEyGUPOR5kS,Escape,03egwBfmIRrfZtGCBhj5kg, Every few thousand years Come true man s greatest fears All the living things Mother nature brings to tears When the bombs are bursting in the air And the rockets are making that red glare I m heading down Down to that good hope town where the weather s fair So why do nt you come away With me my love We ll do what it takes I ll keep you safe Why do nt you stay by me And when the time comes We ll escape When the big one finally hit s LA When Yellowstone has it s day We re heading to the southern tip On a plane or on a ship We ll do what it takes we ll find a way And if that cloud forms up above No sign anywhere of a dove There ll be no reason left to stay We ll try and live another day In a place where there s still love
