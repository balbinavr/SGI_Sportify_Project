Wolfmother,3yEnArbNHyTCwMRvD9SBy4,Joker And The Thief,7ISL3LO8AWP3fKIXunvqTa, I said the joker is a wanted man He makes his way all across the land I see him sifting through the sand So I ll tell you all the story About the joker and the thief in the night He s always laughing in the midst of power Only living in the final hour There is always sweet and sour So we are not goin home Can you see the joker flying over As she s standing in the field of clover Watching out every day I wonder what would happen if he took her away When you see him well you might not know You get the feelin comin after the glow The vagabond is nt moving slow So I ll tell you all the story Bout the joker and the thief in the night All the people that you see in the night Hold their dreams up to the light The wildebeest is sat in my sight And we are not goin home Can you see the joker flying over As she s standing in a field of clover Watching out every day I wonder what would happen if he took her away I said the joker is a wanted man He makes his way all across the land See him sifting through the sand So I ll tell you the story Bout the the joker and the thief I said I ll tell you the story Bout the the joker and the thief I said I ll tell you the story Bout the the joker and the thief in the night
