The Marcus King Band,0tgaHqkU1p7QhBUIzKXVU9,Rita Is Gone,7CEKnpnWXyhNi6tLBGxfAo, She was surrounded while she was alone When did my house become less of a home She was so tired But her eyes remained opened So much to see But her words remained unspoken Weep not for me For my mind was nt holdin no peace Rita carried so much weight Nobody knew til it was too late Rita is gone She ai nt coming back in your lifetime She s gone She wo nt wait for you in your next life Gone gone gone she s gone Said I m loneliest when I m with you At my best when I m alone But I need someone here beside me baby Please do nt stay gone too long Cause your love continues to help me baby This heart s been breaking slowly But this loneliness can kill me faster Find it in yourself to stay Rita is gone She ai nt coming back in your lifetime She s gone She wo nt wait for you in your next life Lord she s gone She ai nt coming back in your lifetime She s gone She wo nt wait for you in your next life Gone gone gone she s gone Rita is gone Gone gone gone she s gone Rita is gone Gone gone gone she s gone Rita is gone Gone gone gone she s gone Rita is gone Gone gone gone she s gone
The Marcus King Band,0tgaHqkU1p7QhBUIzKXVU9,Homesick,4o4NCu0rs6BtQu7YDZHZ76, One more day Watch the sunrise from the highway Lord one more night Sit alone again in the pale moonlight And i do nt know why Seems this ride takes so much longer every time But my heart is due back south You re the only one that makes me homesick You re the only one that keeps me honest The only one Lord the only one That keeps me from staying gone Oooh and one hundred miles Starts to feel like one hundred years As my sanity holds one In my mind I hear her favourite song So damn tired of this ride Turn the headlights on Let the moonlight guide Let it guide me back home You re the only one that makes me homesick You re the only one that keeps me honest The only one Lord the only one That keeps me from staying gone You re the only one that makes me homesick You re the only one that keeps me honest The only one Lord the only one That keeps me from staying gone
