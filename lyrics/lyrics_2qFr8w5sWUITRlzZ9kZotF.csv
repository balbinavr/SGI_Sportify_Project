Jefferson Airplane,2qFr8w5sWUITRlzZ9kZotF,White Rabbit,4vpeKl0vMGdAXpZiQB2Dtd, One pill makes you larger And one pill makes you small And the ones that mother gives you Do nt do anything at all Go ask Alice When she s ten feet tall And if you go chasing rabbits And you know you re going to fall Tell em a hookahsmoking caterpillar Has given you the call He called Alice When she was just small When the men on the chessboard Get up and tell you where to go And you ve just had some kind of mushroom And your mind is moving low Go ask Alice I think she ll know When logic and proportion Have fallen sloppy dead And the White Knight is talking backwards And the Red Queen s off with her head Remember what the dormouse said Feed your head Feed your head

Jefferson Airplane,2qFr8w5sWUITRlzZ9kZotF,Comin' Back to Me,0TBntp6t4oS6UXjxikO5n7, The summer had inhaled And held its breath too long The winter looked the same As if it never had gone And through an open window Where no curtain hung I saw you I saw you Comin back to me One begins to read between The pages of a look The shape of sleepy music And suddenly you re hooked Through the rain upon the trees The kisses on the run I saw you I saw you Comin back to me You came to stay and live my way Scatter my love like leaves in the wind You always say you wo nt go away But I know what it always has been It always has been A transparent dream Beneath an occasional sigh Most of the time I just let it go by Now I wish it had nt begun I saw you yes I saw you Comin back to me Strolling the hills Overlooking the shore I realize I ve been here before The shadow in the mist Could have been anyone I saw you I saw you Comin back to me Small things like reasons Are put in a jar Whatever happened to wishes Wished on a star Was it just something That I made up for fun I saw you I saw you Comin back to me
