Miguel,360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK,Remind Me to Forget,6xTU6B6nFwKKTSZ9ySXS80, It never fades away it s staying Your kiss like broken glass on my skin And all the greatest loves end in violence It s tearing up my voice left in silence Baby it hit so hard holding on to my chest Maybe you left your mark reminding me to forget It does nt matter where you are you can keep my regret Cause baby I got these scars reminding me to forget Reminding me I got these scars to forget your love Keep reminding me ooh to forget your love You left your burn in my heart You left your mark reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark I cant understand You left your burn in my heart You left your mark reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark I cant understand There s no room in war for feelings Hurt me to the core still healing And I know you re no good for me So I try to forget the memories Baby it hit so hard holding on to my chest Maybe you left your mark reminding me to forget It does nt matter where you are you can keep my regret Baby I got these scars reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark I ca nt understand Remember I told you To save it it s over And I ll be alright So hurt me as much as you like I need you to let go I got these mementos And I ll be alright Baby it hit so hard holding on to my chest Maybe you left your mark reminding me to forget It does nt matter where you are you can keep my regret Baby I got these scars reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark reminding me to forget You left your burn in my heart You left your mark reminding me to forget
