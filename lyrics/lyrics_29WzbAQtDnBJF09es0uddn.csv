Corinne Bailey Rae,29WzbAQtDnBJF09es0uddn,Put Your Records On,2nGFzvICaeEWjIrBrL2RAx, Three little birds sat on my window And they told me I do nt need to worry Summer came like cinnamon So sweet Little girls doubledutch on the concrete Maybe sometimes we got it wrong but it s all right The more things seems to change the more they stay the same Oh do nt you hesitate Girl put your records on tell me your favourite song You go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down You re gon na find yourself somewhere somehow Blue as the sky sunburnt and lonely Sipping tea in the bar by the road side Just relax just relax Do nt you let those other boys fool you Got ta love that afro hairdo Maybe sometimes we feel afraid but it s all right The more you stay the same the more they seem to change Do nt you think it s strange Girl put your records on tell me your favourite song You go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down You re gon na find yourself somewhere somehow Just more than I could take pity for pity s sake Some nights kept me awake I thought that I was stronger When you gon na realise that you do nt even have to try any longer Do what you want to Girl put your records on tell me your favourite song You go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down Girl put your records on tell me your favourite song You go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down Oh You re gon na find yourself somewhere somehow
