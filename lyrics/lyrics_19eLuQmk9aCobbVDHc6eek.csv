Louis Armstrong,19eLuQmk9aCobbVDHc6eek,Cheek To Cheek,1gcuhZPKmTYvn5VT5EZLR6, Heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Heaven I m in heaven And the cares that hung around me through the week Seem to vanish like a gambler s lucky streak When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to climb a mountain And to reach the highest peak But it does nt thrill me half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to go out fishing In a river or a creek But I do nt enjoy it half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Dance with me I want my arm about you That charm about you Will carry me through To heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek
Louis Armstrong,19eLuQmk9aCobbVDHc6eek,They Can't Take That Away From Me,094P9Go47bQKJ5Do15lt69, Our romance wo nt end on a sorrowful note Though by tomorrow you re gone The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote The melody lingers on They may take you from me I ll miss your fond caress But though they take you from me I ll still possess The way you wear your hat The way you sip your tea The memory of all that No they ca nt take that away from me The way your smile just beams The way you sing off key The way you haunt my dreams No no they ca nt take that away from me We may never never meet again on that bumpy road to love Still I ll always always keep the memory of The way you hold your knife The way we danced till three The way you changed my life No no they ca nt take that away from me No they ca nt take that away from me
