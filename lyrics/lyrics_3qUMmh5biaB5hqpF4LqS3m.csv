Julie London,3qUMmh5biaB5hqpF4LqS3m,I'm In The Mood For Love,6crfO56bDm0RjpctUuGs5X, I m in the mood for love Simply because you re near me Funny but when you re near me I m in the mood for love Heaven is in your eyes Bright as the stars we re under Oh is it any wonder I m in the mood for love Why stop to think of whether This little dream might fade We ve put our hearts together Now we are one I m not afraid If there s a cloud above If it should rain we ll let it But for tonight forget it I m in the mood for love
Julie London,3qUMmh5biaB5hqpF4LqS3m,Cry Me A River,57bIqEtD8sO3NsagJSaZsb, Now you say you re lonely You cried the long night through Well you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you re sorry For being so untrue Well you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me nearly drove me Out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember I remember All that you said Told me love was too plebeian Told me you were through with me And now you say you love me Well just to prove you do Come on and cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you I cried a river over you I cried a river over you I cried a river over you
Julie London,3qUMmh5biaB5hqpF4LqS3m,Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words),5hbNSo9Ckl7ku8664sn0Jj, Fly me to the moon And let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars In other words Hold my hand In other words Darling kiss me Fill my heart with song And let me sing forever more You are all I long for All I worship and adore In other words Please be true In other words I love you Musical interlude Fill my heart with song And let me sing forever more You are all I long for All I worship and adore In other words Please be true In other words I love you
