Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,Crazy,2N5zMZX7YeL1tico8oQxa9, I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind There was something so pleasant about that place Even your emotions had an echo In so much space And when you re out there without care Yeah I was out of touch But it was nt because I did nt know enough I just knew too much mmm Does that make me crazy Does that make me crazy Does that make me crazy Possibly And I hope that you are having the time of your life But think twice That s my only advice mmm Come on now who do you Who do you who do you who do you think you are Ha ha ha bless your soul You really think you re in control Well I think you re crazy I think you re crazy I think you re crazy Just like me My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb And all I remember Is thinking I want to be like them Mmm ever since I was little Ever since I was little it looked like fun And it s no coincidence I ve come And I can die when I m done But maybe I m crazy Maybe you re crazy Maybe we re crazy Probably
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,Going On,6N7YkCy1oSMRsaZSoz5VlS, I ve seen it with my own eyes How they take all the lies Without the luxury of leavin of leavin The touch and feeling of the free Is intangible technically Something you ve got to believe in believe in Connect the cause and effect One foot in front of the next This is the start of a journey a journey And my mind is already gone And the fear of the unknown Somehow just does nt concern me concern me And you can stand right there if you want But I m going on And I m prepared to go it alone I m going on To a place in the sun that s nice and warm I m going on And I m sure they ll have a place for you too ooh Anyone that needs what they want And does nt want what they need I want nothing to do with to do with And to do what I want And to do what I please Is first off my todo list todo list But every once in a while I think about her smile One of the few things I do miss I do miss But baby I ve got to go Baby I ve got to know Baby I ve got to prove it to prove it And I ll see you when you get there But I m going on And I m prepared to go it alone I m going on May my love lift you up to the place you belong I m going on And I promise I ll be waiting for you ooh Freedom is the word and let me tell you a word of advice Do nt follow me
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,Smiley Faces,3y9p60VKSjscT2M2de0uz8, Well what did you do What did you say Did you walk or did you run away Where are you now Where have you been Did you go alone or did you bring a friend I need to know this cause I noticed you were smilin Out in the sun havin fun and feelin free oh I m feelin free And I can tell you know how hard this life can be But you keep on smilin for me Little girl gon na smile at you Little girl gon na smile at you What went right What went wrong Was it the story or was it the song Was it overnight or did it take you long Was knowing your weakness what made you strong Or all the above oh how I love to see you smiling And oh yeah take a little pain just in case You need something warm to embrace To help you put on a smiling face Little girl gon na smile at you Little girl gon na smile at you Put on a smiling face Do nt you go off into the new day with any doubt Here s a summary of something that you could smile about Say for instance my girlfriend she bugs me all the time But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time Oh see Doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo I want to be you whenever I see you smiling Because its easily one of the hardest things to do hardest things to do Your worries and fears become your friends And they end up smiling at you Put on a smiling face
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,The Boogie Monster,6Gth28s3RFaz7JBeQwznZi, Ooh ah ah ah Dracula was the name And The Boogie Man is my fame I ve got a monster in my closet Someone s underneath my bed The wind s knocking at my window I d kill it but it s already dead It waits til the midnight hour to come To torture me for the wrong I ve done It just sits there and stares at me And it wo nt let me get any sleep I ve got a monster in my closet Someone s underneath my bed The wind s knocking at my window I d kill it but it s already dead At first I was scared when I looked at his eyes But now that I know him I m not that surprised I m just waiting on the sun to rise Oh how I wish that old sun would rise I ve got a monster in my closet Someone s underneath my bed The wind s knocking at my window I d kill it but it s already dead I used to wonder why he looked familiar Then I realized it was a mirror Oh and now it is plain to see The whole time the monster was me Oh there s a monster in my closet Someone s underneath my bed The wind s knocking at my window I d kill it but it s already dead Yeah the living dead Only thing that could bring it back alive woman Is some good good head Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,St. Elsewhere,4Dpe7gca6DuAWPObiDfWXg, I packed a few of my belongings Left the life that I was living Just some memories of it Mostly the ones I ca nt forget Whenever you need me I ll be here Until then my dear I m going I m going going there Do nt ask me to make time To travel back and forth Let nature take its course Maybe I m open from all this ocean air And if it were nt for you I d be without a care Setting sail to St Elsewhere Oh hum hum oh hum hum Anywhere you sit you can see the sun Unfortunately on this island I m the only one Same rules apply on a rainy day And not such a pretty place to be It just rains and rains and rains on me Send a simple sign I can understand Then a flower grew out that sand Before you know it I was back out on that sea Now I do nt mind it so much because as long As I m not there Anywhere St Elsewhere yeah Oh hum hum oh hum hum Way over yonder there s a new frontier Would it be so hard for you To come and visit me here I understand Well just send me a message In a bottle then baby Oh hum hum oh hum hum Oh hum hum She s a loser
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,Just A Thought,5xNUIReo5O6W1LRp2OKJty, All I want is your understanding As in the small act of affection Why is this my life Is almost everybody s question And I ve tried Everything but suicide But it s crossed my mind I prefer peace Would nt have to have one worldly possession But essentially I m an animal So just what do I do with all the aggression Well I ve tried Everything but suicide But it s crossed my mind Life is a oneway street ai nt it If you could paint it I d draw myself going in the right direction So I go all the way like I really really know But the truth is I m only guessin And I ve tried Everything but suicide Oh but it s crossed my mind Just a thought It s even dark in the daytime It s not just good it s great depression When I was lost I even found myself Lookin in the gun s direction And so I ve tried Everything but suicide But yes it s crossed my mind But I m fine
Gnarls Barkley,5SbkVQYYzlw1kte75QIabH,A Little Better,76u0jEq3sF8BVFc64yvK9P, Now I can sing you the story line And if you like my story fine But ai nt none of the glory mine See my life was a lonely one And I was still mama s only son With no idea what I m goin become And I did nt have long to know That you do nt have to be grown to go I could have died so long before Then I finally saw the sign And I made it on down the line One step at a time I feel better I can smile at it now I feel better Oh better And even a little is still better Oh have mercy on me Oh it s probably plain to see That I got a whole lotta pain in me And it will always remain in me So cold it s a crying shame Yet here I am trying again Cause I refuse to die in vain The circumstances put soul in me And there ai nt no holding me I ve got a heart made of gold in me Can you believe this is where I ve been And when adversity comes again I ll deal with it then I feel better I can laugh at it now I feel better Oh better And even a little is still better Oh have mercy on me Whoa I said everything s fine you can take your time What would be on your mind if you knew you was dyin I would wan na just feel thisa one more time I said everything s fine take your time What would be on your mind if you knew you was dyin I would wan na just feel thisa one more time All right I wan na thank you morning sun I wan na thank you loaded gun Now I know I m not the only one I I wan na thank you friendly ghost When all the calls were close It seems like you cared the most I I wan na thank you Mom and Dad For hurting me so bad But you were the best I ever had I I wan na thank you
