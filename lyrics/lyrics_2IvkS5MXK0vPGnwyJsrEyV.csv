Eric Church,2IvkS5MXK0vPGnwyJsrEyV,Springsteen,05ZACkzW8YbRq3eFgIfSNB, To this day when I hear that song I see you standin there on that lawn Discount shades store bought tan Flipflops and cutoff jeans Somewhere between that setting sun I m On Fire and Born To Run You looked at me and I was done And we we re just gettin started I was singin to you you were singin to me I was so alive never been more free Fired up my daddy s lighter and we sang Sang Ooh ooh Stayed there til they forced us out And took the long way to your house I can still hear the sound Of you sayin Do nt go When I think about you I think about seventeen I think about my old Jeep I think about the stars in the sky Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen I bumped into you by happenstance You probably would nt even know who I am But if I whispered your name I bet There d still be a spark From back when I was gasoline And this old tattoo had brand new ink And we did nt care what your mom would think Bout your name on my arm Baby is it spring or is it summer The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer You hear sometimes late at night On your radio Even though you re a million miles away When you hear Born In The USA Do you relive those glory days So long ago When you think about me do you think about seventeen Do you think about my old Jeep Think about the stars in the sky Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen Springsteen Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night Springsteen Springsteen Whoa Springsteen
