Michael Bubl,1GxkXlMwML1oSg5eLPiAz3,It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,0lLdorYw7lVrJydTINhWdI, It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas Everywhere you go Take a look at the five and ten It s glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas Everywhere you go There s a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well It s the sturdy kind that does nt mind the snow It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas Soon the bells will start And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door So it s Christmas once more

Michael Bubl,1GxkXlMwML1oSg5eLPiAz3,Cold December Night,4FPrAERfkPKOBKrRoyuxLu, Stockings are hung with care As children sleep with one eye open Well now there s more than toys at stake Cause I m older now but not done hoping The twinkling of the lights The scent of candles fill the household Ol Saint Nick has taken flight With a heart on board so please be careful Each year I ask for many different things But now I know what my heart wants you to bring So please just fall in love with me this Christmas There s nothing else that I will need this Christmas Wo nt be wrapped under a tree I want something that lasts forever So kiss me on this cold December night A tree that smells of pine A house that s filled with joy and laughter The mistletoe says stand in line Loneliness is what I ve captured Oh but this evening can be a holy night So cozy on up by the fireplace And dim those Christmas lights So please just fall in love with me this Christmas There s nothing else that we will need this Christmas Wo nt be wrapped under a tree I want something that lasts forever So kiss me on this cold December night They call it the season of giving I m here I m yours for the taking They call it the season of giving I m here I m yours Just fall in love with me this Christmas There s nothing else that we will need this Christmas Wo nt be wrapped under a tree I want something that lasts forever Cause I do nt want to be alone tonight I ll wear you like a Christmas sweater Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight I want something to last forever So kiss me on this cold December Night Call it the season of giving I m here I m yours for the taking Call it the season of giving I m here I m yours

Michael Bubl,1GxkXlMwML1oSg5eLPiAz3,Love You Anymore,7JEUg9KqmpdIE5Nbb9ss66, Just because I wander round the places we would go Hopin that I d run into you one last time Just because I never took your picture off my phone Does nt mean that you re still on my mind Just because I accidentally slip and say your name When I hear our song it makes me insecure Just because I know I ll never ever feel the same Does nt mean I love you anymore Am I lyin to myself again When I say you re not the best I ve ever had Am I lyin to myself again When I say that I m not missing you so bad Just because I m on my knees and swearing I will change And I d do anything to hear you say I m yours Just because I know I ll never ever feel the same Does nt mean I love you anymore Am I lyin to myself again When I say you re not the best I ve ever had Am I lyin to myself again When I say that I m not missing you so bad Just because I m on my knees and swearing I will change And do anything to hear you say I m yours Just because I know I ll never ever feel the same Does nt mean I love you anymore more Does nt mean I love you anymore Anymore anymore Does nt mean I love you anymore
