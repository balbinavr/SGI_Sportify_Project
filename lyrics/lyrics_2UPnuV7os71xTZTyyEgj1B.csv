Steve Tyrell,2UPnuV7os71xTZTyyEgj1B,I'm Through With Love,0O6Pk2ks9rrA9oztFewSh5, I m through with love I ll never fall again Said I do to love Do nt ever call again For I must have you Or no one That s why I m through with love I ve locked my heart I keep my feelings there I have stopped my heart Like an icy frigidaire For I need to care for no one That s why I m through with love Why did you leave me To think that you cared You did nt need me You have your share Of slaves around you To hound you and swear Their deep devotion Emotion Did you good by the spring And all it meant to me A good neighbor The things that used to be For I must have you or no one That s why I m through with love That s why I m through with love
