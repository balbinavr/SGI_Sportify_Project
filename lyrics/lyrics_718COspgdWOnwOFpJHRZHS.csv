Luke Combs,718COspgdWOnwOFpJHRZHS,When It Rains It Pours,1mMLMZYXkMueg65jRRWG1l, Sunday morning man she woke up fighting mad Bitching and moaning on and on bout the time I had And by Tuesday you could say that girl was good as gone Then when Thursday came around I was all alone So I went for a drive to clear my mind ended up at a Shell on I65 Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it She swore they were a waist of time oh but she was wrong I was caller number 5 on a radio station won a 4day 3night beach vacation Deep sea senorita fishing down in Panama And I ai nt got ta see my ex future motherinlaw anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours When it rains it pours Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial And it s crazy how this now just seems to come in when What I thought was gon na be the death of me was my saving grace It s got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason That I got the last spot in the Hooter s parking lot And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle Won a used fourwheeler and three free passes For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf And I ai nt got ta see my ex future motherinlaw anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours When it rains it pours Well I ve been on a hell of a redneck road for three weeks now And it all started on the day that she walked out Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it She swore they were a waist of time oh but she was wrong I was caller number 5 on a radio station won a 4day 3night beach vacation Deep sea senorita fishing down in Panama And I ai nt got ta see my ex future motherinlaw anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours When it rains it pours
Luke Combs,718COspgdWOnwOFpJHRZHS,One Number Away,4gB7HrYHbJVJ5RFOjxmoq4, Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings Are you watching a movie that you ve seen a thousand times Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines If you re anything like me You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise But I just wan na hear your voice And I m one number away from calling to you I said I was through but I m dying inside Got my head in a mess girl I confess I lied when I said I m leaving and not coming back Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go I see your face In my brain dial it up everything I want to say But I m still one number away Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song Maybe it s a mistake hit the brakes I m moving on If you re anything like me You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm But I m almost out that door And I m one number away from calling to you I said I was through but I m dying inside Got my head in a mess girl I confess I lied when I said I m leaving and not coming back Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go I see your face In my brain dial it up everything I want to say But I m still one number away Will you pick up when I call Or just forget we loved at all We do nt have to talk I just wan na hear your voice And I m one number away from calling to you I said I was through but I m dying inside Got my head in a mess girl I confess I lied when I said I m leaving and not coming back Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go I see your face In my brain dial it up anything I want to say But I m still one number away Away Away Yea I m still one number away
