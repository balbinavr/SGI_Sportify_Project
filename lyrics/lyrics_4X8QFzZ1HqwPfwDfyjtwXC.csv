Mel Torm,4X8QFzZ1HqwPfwDfyjtwXC,The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On an Open Fire),6pyIRpxFSGo6iYIwRtj4xG, Chestnuts roasting on an open fire Jack Frost nipping at your nose Yuletide carols being sung by a choir And folks dressed up like Eskimos Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe Help to make the season bright Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa s on his way He s loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh And every mother s child is gon na spy To see if reindeer really know how to fly So I m offering this simple phrase To kids from one to ninetytwo Although it s been said many times many ways Merry Christmas to you So I m offering this simple phrase To kids from one to ninetytwo Although it s been said many times many ways Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Merry Christmas to you
