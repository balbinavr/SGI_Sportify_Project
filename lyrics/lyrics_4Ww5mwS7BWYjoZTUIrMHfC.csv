Charlie Parker,4Ww5mwS7BWYjoZTUIrMHfC,All the Things You Are,6AAxndfN25URaM9zQJfWbU, Time and again I ve longed for adventure Something to make my heart beat much faster What did I long for I never really knew Finding your love I found my adventure Touching your hand my heart beat much faster All that I want in all of this world is you You are the promised kiss of springtime That makes the lonely winter seem long You are the breathless hush of evening That trembles on the brink of a lovely song You are the angel glow that lights the star The dearest things I know are what you are Someday my happy arms will hold you And someday I ll know that moment divine When all the things you are are mine

Charlie Parker,4Ww5mwS7BWYjoZTUIrMHfC,Laura,5YIhyj0uiGSJPLARP7nzte, You know the feeling of something half remembered Of something that never happened yet you recall it well You know the feeling of recognizing someone That you ve never met as far as you could tell well Laura is the face in the misty light Footsteps that you hear down the hall The laugh that floats on a summer night That you can never quite recall And you see Laura on the train that is passing through Those eyes how familiar they seem She gave your very first kiss to you That was Laura but she s only a dream
