Screamin' Jay Hawkins,3VBpsrUi2vV7Uj87ONHu7Z,Frenzy,756R19at7dgLPY7HMhRnPx, Frenzy Dig this crazy mood I m in Listen to my heart as it starts to spin Whish when you kiss me and do it again I m in a Frenzy Watch my eyes when you light them up Bling Listen to me whine like a harpsichord When you touch me I warm right up I m in a Frenzy Frenzy This love gushes from my heart Like a water from a spout You build a flame from a tiny spark You can really knock me out Yeah Ease my mind with your real cool lines Daddy fill my soul with love divine When you say you re mine all mine I m in a Frenzy This love gushes from my heart Like a water from a spout You build a flame from a tiny spark You can really knock me out Yeah Ease my mind with your real cool lines Daddy fill my soul with love divine When you say you re mine all mine I m in a Frenzy Frenzy
Screamin' Jay Hawkins,3VBpsrUi2vV7Uj87ONHu7Z,There's Something Wrong With You,61WI7N4yI6muXrG295Wp7P, There s something wrong with you Something s missing some place somewhere There s something wrong with you I mean sometimes you just say it all there Now now now now take a look at yourself I m telling you I ai nt lying girl You look like something else I do nt know what is wrong But if you keep lookin like that Do nt you know that I ll be gone There s something wrong with you I mean you just say like you was Lets face it There s something I got ta do I mean to find out the cause You swore up and down That you would love me so You said pumpkins would look like pickles Before you let me go Well I m just tired at it all You can stop your show Do nt you know you can be replaced you know Monkey toes and strain beans Roast bamboo sallad Smuttered with bubble gums Big barbecue gorilla riffs A dish of cow fingers and mousquito pies There s something wrong with you
