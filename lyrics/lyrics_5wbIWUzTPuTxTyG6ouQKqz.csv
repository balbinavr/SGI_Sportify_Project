Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Farmhouse,5dVtj4IAnYSrI3jVfIFIaC, Welcome this is a Farmhouse We have cluster flies alas And this time of year is bad We are so very sorry There s little we can do But swat them She did nt beg oh not enough She did nt stay when things got tough I told a lie and she got mad She was nt there when things got bad I never ever saw the northern lights I never really heard of cluster flies Never ever saw the stars so bright In the farmhouse things will be alright Woke this morning to the stinging lash Every man rise from the ash Each betrayal begins with trust Every man returns to dust
Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Sample In a Jar,6MCUdqOifrEomDtrgZlJ8O, Its hidden far away But someday I may tell The tale of mental tangle when into your world I fell Without you now I d wander soaking secretly afraid But in your grasp the fears do nt last Though some of them have stayed I wheeled around because I Did nt hear what you had said And saw you dancin with Elihu Up on Leemor s bed And I was foggy rather groggy You helped me to my car The bindin belts enclosin me A sample in a jar And the market stands unfolding With all the willies and their wares I shuffled by alert but numb To all the glances and the glares I think of you unheeding All the times I raised my cup Its now I know that you knew that I d soon end up end up I wheeled around because I I Did nt hear what you had said And saw you dancin with Elihu Up on Leemor s bed And I was foggy rather groggy You helped me to my car The bindin belts enclosin me A sample in a jar You tricked me like the others And now I do nt belong The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong Sample in a Jar goes A C G D A Emaj Emin D A D E D Then D The binding belt Enclosing me A sample in a C Jarryou tricked me like the D Others and Now I feel all G Wrong C The simple smiles and D Good times seem all Emaj Wroooooonnnnngggg
Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Heavy Things,12gHzpb83V2Eh6D2sKUPlU, Things are falling down on me Heavy things I could not see When I finally came around Something small would pin me down When I try to step aside I move to where they d hoped I d be Vanessa calls me on the phone Reminding me I m not alone I fuss and quake and cavitate I try to speak and turn to stone Tilly reaches through my vest To do the thing that she does best She probes and tears my ventricles Steals my one remaining breath Things are falling down on me Heavy things I could not see When I finally came around Something small would pin me down When I try to step aside I move to where they d hoped I d be Stumbling as I fall from Grace She needs my vision to replace Her ailing sight throughout the night Leaving two holes in my face Mary was a friend I d say Till one summer day She borrowed everything I owned And then simply ran away Things are falling down on me Heavy things I could not see When I finally came around Something small would pin me down When I try to step aside I move to where they d hoped I d be
Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Waste,6dKntZwVJx0QLX6IM19gC7, Do nt want to be an actor pretending on the stage Do nt want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page Do nt want to be a painter cause everyone comes to look Do nt want to be anything where my life s an open book A dream it s true but I d see it through If I could be wasting my time with you Do nt want to be a farmer working in the sun Do nt want to be an outlaw always on the run Do nt want to be a climber reaching for the top Do nt want to be anything where I do nt know when to stop A dream it s true and I d see it through If I could be wasting my time with you So if I m inside your head Do nt believe what you might have read You ll see what I might have said to hear it Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me So if I m inside your head Do nt believe what you might have read You ll see what I might have said to hear it Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me Come waste your time with me
Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Bouncing Around the Room,4pYQb0fYwPbTD09uDhiQzU, The woman was a dream I had though rather hard to keep For when my eyes were watching hers They closed and I was still asleep For when my hand was holding hers She whispered words and I awoke And faintly bouncing round the room The echo of whomever spoke I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room The echo of whomever spoke The place I saw was far beneath the surface of the sea My sight was poor but I was sure the sirens sang their songs for me They dance above me as I sink I see them through a crystal haze And hear them bouncing round the room The never ending coral maze The crystal haze and hear them bouncing round the room The never ending coral maze Then before and now once more I m bouncing round the room Overlapping and Repeating That time then and once again I m bouncing round the room I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room The echo of whomever spoke
Phish,5wbIWUzTPuTxTyG6ouQKqz,Free,6cAP4aefOH4dYOpdrldV2f, I m floating in the blimp a lot I feel the feeling I forgot Swimming weightless in the womb Bouncing gently round the room In a minute I ll be free And we ll be splashing in the sea I feel no curiosity I see the path ahead of me In a minute I ll be free And we ll be splashing in the sea We hear a tiny cry As the ship goes sliding by Free Free Free I m floating in the blimp a lot I feel the feeling I forgot I m floating in the blimp a lot I feel free Free Free Free Free
