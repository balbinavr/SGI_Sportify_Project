Tony Bennett,2lolQgalUvZDfp5vvVtTYV,Winter Wonderland,4ricyQVd20UQde1jpXCSuJ, Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening A beautiful sight We re happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is a new bird He sings a love song As we go along Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is Parson Brown He ll say Are you married We ll say No man But you can do the job When you re in town Later on we ll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we ve made Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he s a circus clown We ll have lots of fun with mister snowman Until the other kids knock him down When it snows ai nt it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling We ll frolic and play the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland

Tony Bennett,2lolQgalUvZDfp5vvVtTYV,Anything Goes,3Cq4BUlxDg4ulj7XnN2COP, In olden days a glimpse of stocking Was looked on as something shocking Now heaven knows Anything goes Good authors too who once knew better words Now only use four letter words Writing prose Anything goes The world has gone mad today And good s bad today and day s night today And black s white today When most guys today that women prize today Are just silly gigolos Though I m not a great romancer I know that you re bound to answer When I propose And anything goes The world has gone mad today And good s bad today and day s night today And black s white today When most guys today that women prize today Are just silly gigolos And though I m not a great romancer I know that you re bound to answer When I propose And anything goes anything goes Anything goes
Tony Bennett,2lolQgalUvZDfp5vvVtTYV,They Cant Take That Away From Me,0F73NxI5rMBio3hk9HGPLp, Steppin Out Intro Our romance wo nt end on a sorrowful note Though by tomorrow you re gone The song is ended but as the song writer wrote The melody lingers on They may take you from me I ll miss your fond caress But though they take you from me I ll still possess The way you wear your hat The way you sip your tea The memory of all that No they ca nt take that away from me The way your smile just beams The way you sing off key The way you haunt my dreams No they ca nt take that away from me We may never never meet again on that bumpy road to love But I ll always always keep the memory of The way you hold your knife The way we danced till three The way you changed my life No they ca nt take that away from me
Tony Bennett,2lolQgalUvZDfp5vvVtTYV,Cheek To Cheek,0UuRIovHyU6KeTzY4gS0L2, Heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Heaven I m in heaven And the cares that hung around me through the week Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak When we re out together dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to climb a mountain And to reach the highest peak But it does nt thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek Oh I love to go out fishing In a river or a creek But I do nt enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek Dance with me I want my arm about you That charm about you will carry me through to Heaven Yes I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find that happiness I seek When we re out together swinging cheek to cheek Come on and dance with me I want my arm about you That charm about you will carry me through Right up to Heaven I m in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find that happiness I seek When we re out together dancing Out together dancing Out together dancing cheek to cheek
