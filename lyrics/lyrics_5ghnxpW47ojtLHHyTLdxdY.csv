Witt Lowry,5ghnxpW47ojtLHHyTLdxdY,Kindest Regards,67HRSCGK3ZQIxb3Spr1cHQ, Here to tell you the truth tell you I m nervous Tell you my story tell you I m worth it Tell you my flaws and my faults and my doubts Give you my heart and what s left of it now Tell you my hurt tell you my pain Tell you the thoughts I keep trapped in my brain Tell you that nothing s the same Tell you I m nothin much more than a man And tell you I fear I may never find love Tell you I m gettin in touch with above And right now ca nt deny that I m scared all this music I wrote wo nt compare or warrant the buzz Alone in my room dissectin each line that I rhyme I do nt know how I ll finish on time Missed the drop date three times I know that I let you all down Well I was the first in that line so Sever my soul from my body engulf it in music Then give you something to relate This is somewhere to go when your heart becomes cold And your friends become fake As you stand on the edge of the world You feel like you re destined to break And your grandma is screaming You re worthless And calling you names to your face Mom and I had to move to a place Second time that I ll rhyme to paint this picture And I ca nt deny I would hide in my room And would cry from dealing with ya Pictures so vivid you yell in the kitchen I m takin my boxes I ve made a decision I m done with your dissin your father there fixin I tried to be nice but you just would nt listen I could nt wait for the day Just to give you my take on the shit that you did Silly old bitch never be like you never be so rude I hope I wish alone and sick you sit but this is where we end it It s crazy to me how the truth is often most offensive Battle tested learned my lesson to forgive but not forget I spilled my heart opened my chest Irrelevant you are to me but part to me honestly Thought I should address life often makes this mess I ve come to give you more while everybody gives you less Yeah and lookin back on it all was a lie At your friend s house and there s no other guys Surprise and look who you re with I m not tryin to diss I m just tellin you this That your feelings may fade but your memories stick Hope you re happy with him I honestly hope you re happy with him And he does all the things that I would and I tried But I could nt could keep going on but I know that I shouldnt I should nt waste any more time Should nt waste any more lines When you re drunk off the wine do you find Me crossin your mind We knew this would happen with time But I think that we finally figured it out That we would just never work out I tried pickin you up you tried pullin me down But now life without you is where happy is found And right now I m just focused on music trust you would lose it Ripped out my heart you abused and you used it Love s not a label on Facebook When I gave you everything like girl wait look But you did nt care I would just stare at my wall And you gave me no reason at all when you left Picked myself up when you made me feel less Much better off and at that I detest Well now let s just put it to rest I wish you the best My friends do nt respond to my texts Yes I ve been busy with Kindest Regards But is it that hard just to call I wan na hang out yet you re shutting me out And you put in no effort at all Now you got me confused like What did I do Used to tell you if I ll make it I ll be bringin all of you Now my circles are limited a few And yall walked out and left that left no one to lose I got nothing to lose And nothin to gain by not tellin the truth Been barely believing in love I still really do nt even know if I do But if someone was ever to make me believe Then that someone is you I promise it s you I never took action you re snapchattin Askin me where all my music is at We re talkin right now as I m writin this rap You re someone I wish that I always could have And to be blatant girl your name is Still ca nt say it Never could say it scared you would hate it Wonder what crosses your mind when you play it I m patient I m waiting for you Even wrote Rescue about me and you Maybe one day we ll be we ll wait and we ll see Now I m chasin my dream and I hope you do too And I m hopin to prove I m payin my dues Dad would get drunk and pass out I m like What are you doin Booze and you lose it he knew it So he got sober so proud I knew you could do it I m out at a party yall tell me to drink Here s what I think I think you look stupid Sinkin my soul in the music I do it for free and just know that I m woven into it My fans we turned into fam I m here to guide you give me your hands Tell me your thoughts and your dreams and your plans They told me I never could be what I am Now look where we stand We stand for everything we said we d stand for When they tried to give us less we said Nah fuck that We demand more and we stand tall Dan told me Jump on that beat and go tell em the truth That s what I do I do this for you I tell you my story to help you get through And you see that this life is hard The darkest nights make the brightest stars I m bringing yall with me let s raise the bar I know yall can feel this whoever you are Kindest Regards Mark
Witt Lowry,5ghnxpW47ojtLHHyTLdxdY,Wonder If You Wonder,2fnwiUU3LEvEy7xByzzaDV, Know it s been a long time I hear you re doin just fine Graduated got a job and you been working a grind You re never looking behind I know you never found me crossing your mind But I d be lying if you did nt cross mine From time to time I see some of your pictures online Kindest Regards was hard I left my heart on the line I wrote a song for you took a couple months of my time How can you praise him for flowers and a bottle of wine You ll never be mine remember the time I came to see you I thought it would just be you but there s twelve other people You see there was never We so we could never be a sequel Thought it might ve been a date that day did anything to see you But I m nothing more than nothing you re bluffin sayin you care Our only real connection is memories that we share I would never try to blame you cause blaming you is nt fair Not that you care the stress is really starting to wear And in my music I took our story and I used it Do nt care how you were feeling I m busy dropping my new shit Know people gon na love it I m buzzin after I do it I m gifted with the curse of honesty and the truth is I loved you more than words I did nt know how to prove it Ca nt tell you that in person but always could through my music Everyone who said they cared is nt there now I m confused I m broken and bruised lonely open empty and stupid and still I I thought I had it all figured out No you would never fall for me now I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now You can hear the pain in my sound Laughed as I fell to the ground I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now And I ca nt lie it hurt a little when you said you did nt want me To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me Every pic I see is you and him his Twitter trying to taunt me You think I let it go This is old and exhausting Some offspring family in a house is what I thought about Sometimes I wonder if he ll get that now See we know that you picked a different path Me I picked a different route And I ca nt help but laugh at how this all played out You re over me now I m hoping you found only the best Remember when we used to rap that Kanye West Graduation in rotation cause you liked that best And back then I did nt want you now look I m a mess I open my chest and through me you can see no spine My profile pic and lyrics I ve been hiding behind It looks like you found the love that I was hopin to find The only you I love s the one that I create in my mind and still I I thought I had it all figured out No you would never fall for me now I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now You can hear the pain in my sound Laughed as I fell to the ground I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now I thought I had it all figured out No you would never fall for me now I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now You can hear the pain in my sound Laughed as I fell to the ground I wonder if you wonder why I m never around I wonder if you I wonder if you wonder what I m doing right now I often wonder if you ever did care I wonder why in my mind is the only time you ever were there See we were friends but that felt more like pretend this year It s awfully clear the real us is what I fear The one where we were only friends and I d act like we dated And nowadays our conversation is Hey happy belated And every song I wrote for you you know you actually hated Because you realize that you never felt the same when you played it You never cared if I made it that s why I waited you know me See all the love that I ve been getting through my phone feels phony I rhyme a couple words together every girl wan na blow me We re in a world full of people yet I m feeling so lonely If only I could tell myself there s plenty fish in the sea But see the sea is full of sharks fake guppies and greed And as I find myself drowning while I m fighting to breathe I realize that I m in love with what I thought we could be

Tori Solkowski),5aPBjXn28piLM1jCFeg45B, Quite surprised Just one look into your eyes Can change my mind Then again I do nt mind I seem to find All the answers to the questions I do nt like But you make them all alright Yeah I often wonder what really it is that you offer me At least I feel your touch even if it s just when you walk on me Your mind is always elsewhere it s there it s on then it s off of me I want to feel your depth but your heart is deaf when you talk to me I guess that s what we were taught We open up dependin on how many drinks we have bought He wants your head and it s ironic does nt care bout your thoughts You re one more drink away from drowning feeling empty and lost But me I m no better she wants to fuck around and I let her A culture now of we re together but was never together I know you re lookin for onenight and I ve been stuck on forevers I think it s sad that I m naive to think that we could do better but fuck it I should ve known from the start And even after all this time I still do nt know who you are There s more to life than likes and hoppin bars and gettin high inside your car You re feelin distant feeling far your wall is up I know it s hard and so Tell me somethin only you know Give me reason not to go You have my heart if I have yours then let me know And tell me somethin only you know You have feelings you do nt show So how am I supposed to know If you love me let me know Let me know Let me know I often wonder what really it is that I offer you At least you feel my touch even if it s just when I walk on you My mind is always elsewhere it s there it s on then it s off of you You want to feel my depth but my heart is deaf when I talk to you A viscous game that we play See nowadays they say love and hate are one and the same You let me beat around the bush until you re sick of my games It s never fair because you care and I just transfer the blame I transfer my pain a shame to know that you could do better How selfish is it my concern as if I m makin you wetter How selfish is it you just want me cause I make you feel better And we just chop it up to bein drunk there s wine on your sweater Alone but together we always make it less than it seems It s funny how if you have feelin s you re weak so we say less than we mean You hate waitin we re not datin and not vocal We re gameplayin I hate sayin but still hopeful I m conflicted I m lost in a lot of women I know our situation s been sticky since the beginnin She left me out in limbo you deal with my indecision Do nt know if you ll ever love me or love the talent I m given but fuck it I should ve known from the start How can I feel so fuckin lonely with your hands on my heart Your hands on my chest you whisper What do you want to do next Our generation s taken love out of sex and so the question is left Tell me somethin only you know Give me reason not to go You have my heart if I have yours then let me know And tell me somethin only you know You have feelings you do nt show So how am I supposed to know If you love me let me know Let me know Let me know Let me know Let me know Ooh let me know Know let me know let me know
Witt Lowry,5ghnxpW47ojtLHHyTLdxdY,Silicone Kingdom,6R9u8nnM6m3hzdkoov1tJR, Hears mom and dad yellin mom always wanted divorce Dad calling momma a whore Drunk been drinking all weekend a couple of Coors A couple of doors were broke in cover the floor damn He s always told never to tell If anybody finds out he ll be put in a cell Hit with a belt there will be nobody to help And so he prays everyday while he s stuck in this hell All to himself he holds every ounce of it in All the kids who have things always laughing at him All the teachers see his pain but he s playing pretend Playing with friends is something he wishes he can But nobody wants to give him a chance Nobody wants to be with a man Been looking at the future but the future is so far in advance Looking at the alcohol in his hand Like damn like why why God Why do I do this again And Why am I getting so drunk See my dad was a drunk I do nt wan na be him I I know I m searching for feelings I thought I could find them in bottles of gin I m tired of losing my faith and then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou She goes to read another message Hoe slut stupid and fake She does nt know how much she can take She s looking at her body it s a body that she plans to replacefake Everything all over her facefake Smile leads up to her lashes never been asked about passion Only been asked about passin the blunt to the left Or a pic of her chest call a bitch and a mess she s a wreck Waiting for a text from a guy Who tell her that he love her but he wan na see her cry Who tell her that he love her but he beat her every night With a pipe out a spite she might leave him for a guy With a tie and a job a Mike or a Rob She s tired and sobs on the knob of a door Yelling out Please I ca nt take no more And he s yelling out Fuck you You cunt you whore Damn she does nt wan na be on the news Only 22 looking down the barrel of a 22 Looking for a move she can make Looking at the bruise on her face never felt safe Never felt late til the end of the month Looking down at her stomach like What have we done I was looking for love and you were lookin for fun And now a life is in my body cause you wanted to cum Like why why God Why do I do this again And Why am I thinking that we could find love inside lust See we love to pretend I I know I m searching for feelings I thought I could find them by fucking with him I m tired of losing my faith and then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou He s addicted to the world s most dangerous drug The one that ll make you lose everything that you love And we do nt understand money does nt buy love So we pile up all our money just to buy us A new car some new rims a new Benz Does nt have friends no more An iPod an iPad an iMac So rich that he s feeling poor If he had one chance to go back Wishes that he never bagged a whore A couple more Coors and a broken door Shattered decor all over the floor Coming home at a quarter to four coming home is a bore Looking at a Gin bottle got a quarter to pour At a local titty bar he got a better rapport No cover ones cover the floor really looking for more And more money makes more problems He do nt understand how to solve em Does nt understand his son and his wife are his life every night When they fight now he s looking at them as a problem That s a problem now he does nt know what to do Out of touch leaving town every weekend or two Thinking money maybe buy us all the happiness too Til he s sitting in a room staring back at a 22 Like what happened to life I went so many years and I thought I was right I went so many years never livin my life And I m scared that my son turns out just like Me why me my God Everything I see really is a facade Fake love fake hair fake nails fake bod We replace as a race and we try to play God Like why why God why do I do this again And Why am I getting so drunk See my dad was a drunk I do nt wan na be him I I know I m searching for feelings I thought I could find them in bottles of gin I I know we re thinking that we could find love inside lust see we love to pretend I I know a part of the problem is silicone kingdom we re living within I m tired of losing my faith and then looking to fake to replace all of my feelings within I I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou I do nt wan na lose myself lose myself I do nt wan na lose myself Just to rule The silicone kingdom with youou with yououou
