Nils Landgren,6B3ZWSop1mrJd71rwFozVP,I Will Survive,1o4szgHxZ53JbD3QUDQ7HE, At first I was afraid I was petrified I kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side But then I spent so many nights Thinking how you did me wrong And I grew strong And I learned how to get along And so you re back from outer space I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I shouldve changed that stupid lock I shouldve made you leave your key If I had known for just one second Youd back to bother me Go on now go walk out the door And just turn around now Cause youre not welcome anymore Werent you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye Did you think Id crumble Did you think Id lay down and die Oh no not I I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive I got all my life to live I got all my love to give And Ill survive I will survive It took all the strength i had Not to fall apart I kept trying out to mend the pieces of my broken heart I spent oh so all many nights just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry But now I hold my head up high And you see me Somebody new Im not that chained up little person still in love with you And so you felt like droppin in and just expect me to be free Now Im savin all my lovin For someone whos lovin me Go on now go walk out the door And just turn around now Cause youre not welcome anymore Werent you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye Did you think Id crumble Did you think Id lay down and die Oh no not I I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive Ive got all my life to live Ive got all my love to give And Ill survive I will survive
