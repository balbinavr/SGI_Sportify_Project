Bruce Springsteen,3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT,Dancing In the Dark,7FwBtcecmlpc1sLySPXeGE, I get up in the evening And I ai nt got nothing to say I come home in the morning I go to bed feeling the same way I ai nt nothing but tired Man I m just tired and bored with myself Hey there baby I could use just a little help You ca nt start a fire You ca nt start a fire without a spark This gun s for hire Even if we re just dancing in the dark Messages keep getting clearer Radio s on and I m moving round the place I check my look in the mirror Wan na change my clothes my hair my face Man I ai nt getting nowhere I m just livin in a dump like this There s something happening somewhere Baby I just know that there is You ca nt start a fire You ca nt start a fire without a spark This gun s for hire Even if we re just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older There s a joke here somewhere and it s on me I ll shake this world off my shoulders Come on baby the laugh s on me Stay on the streets of this town And they ll be carving you up alright They say you got ta stay hungry Hey baby I m just about starving tonight I m dying for some action I m sick of sittin round here trying to write this book I need a love reaction Come on baby gim me just one look You ca nt start a fire Sittin round crying over a broken heart This gun s for hire Even if we re just dancing in the dark You ca nt start a fire Worrying about your little world falling apart This gun s for hire Even if we re just dancing in the dark Even if we re just dancing in the dark Even if we re just dancing in the dark Even if we re just dancing in the dark Hey baby

Bruce Springsteen,3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT,Thunder Road,56lhDZNQ5J47aog6mGKeGk, The screen door slams Mary s dress sways Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays Roy Orbison s singing for the lonely Hey that s me and I want you only Do nt turn me home again I just ca nt face myself alone again Do nt run back inside darling you know just what I m here for So you re scared and you re thinking that maybe we ai nt that young anymore Show a little faith there s magic in the night You ai nt a beauty but hey you re alright Oh and that s alright with me You can hide neath your covers and study your pain Make crosses from your lovers throw roses in the rain Waste your summer praying in vain For a savior to rise from these streets Well now I m no hero that s understood All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood With a chance to make it good somehow Hey what else can we do now Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair Well the night s busted open these two lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real to trade in these wings on some wheels Climb in back heaven s waiting down on the tracks Oh come take my hand We re riding out tonight to case the promised land Oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road Oh Thunder Road Lying out there like a killer in the sun Hey I know it s late we can make it if we run Oh Thunder Road sit tight Take hold Thunder Road Well I got this guitar and I ve learned how to make it talk And my car s out back if you re ready to take that long walk From your front porch to my front seat The door s open but the ride ai nt free And I know you re lonely for words that I ai nt spoken Tonight we ll be free all the promises will be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet And in the lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on But when you get to the porch they re gone on the wind So Mary climb in It s a town full of losers I m pulling out of here to win
Bruce Springsteen,3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT,The River,7HrzErXq3TsKOY1gmdIShB, I come from down in the valley Where mister when you re young They bring you up to do like your daddy done Me and Mary we met in high school When she was just seventeen We d drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green We d go down to the river And into the river we d dive Oh down to the river we d ride Then I got Mary pregnant And man that was all she wrote And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat We went down to the courthouse And the judge put it all to rest No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle No flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river And into the river we d dive Oh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company But lately there ai nt been much work on account of the economy Now all them things that seemed so important Well mister they vanished right into the air Now I just act like I do nt remember Mary acts like she do nt care But I remember us riding in my brother s car Her body tanned and wet down at the reservoir At night on them banks I d lie awake And pull her close just to feel each breath she d take Now those memories come back to haunt me They haunt me like a curse Is a dream a lie if it do nt come true Or is it something worse That sends me down to the river Though I know the river is dry That sends me down to the river tonight Down to the river my baby and I Oho down to the river we ride
