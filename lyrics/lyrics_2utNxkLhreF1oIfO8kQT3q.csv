Manfred Mann's Earth Band,2utNxkLhreF1oIfO8kQT3q,For You,5cVohoOf4zIKtze7nir0L7, Princess cards she sends me With her regards Oh barroom eyes shine vacancy To see her you got ta look hard Wounded deep in battle I stand stuffed like some solider undaunted To her cheshire smile I ll stand on file She s all I ever wanted You let your blue walls get in the way of these facts honey Get your carpetbaggers off my back Girl give me time to cover my tracks She said Here s your mirror and your ball and jacks But they re not what I came for Oh I came for so much more And I know you know that too And I know you know that s true I came for you I came for you I came for you for you I came for you Crawl into my ambulance Your pulse is getting weak Reveal yourself all to me now While you got the strength to speak Cause they re waiting for you at Bellevue With their oxygen masks But I could give it all to you now If only you could ask Do nt call for your surgeon even he says it s late It s not your lungs this time but your heart holds your fate Do nt give me my money back do nt want it anymore It s not that nursery mouth I came back for It s not the way you stretched out on the floor I ve broken all your windows and I rammed through all your doors And who am I to ask you to fight my wars And you should know that s true You should know that too I came for you I came for you I came for you for you I came for you Do nt call for your surgeon even he says it s late It s not your lungs this time but your heart holds your fate Do nt give me my money back do nt want it anymore It s not that nursery mouth I came back for It s not the way you stretched out on the floor I ve broken all your windows and I rammed through all your doors Who am I to ask you to fight my wars And you should know that s true You should know that too I came for you I came for you I came for you I came for you I came for you for you I came for you I came for you
Manfred Mann's Earth Band,2utNxkLhreF1oIfO8kQT3q,Questions,4MxcSuiST4oWg2CgV0j0wM, In a dream it would seem I went to those who close the open door And turning the key I sat and spoke to those inside of me They answered my questions with questions And they pointed me into the night Where the moon was a starpainted dancer And the world was just a spectrum of light They reached to my center of reason And pulled on the touchstone that s there The shock of that light had me reeling And I fell into the depths of despair Turning the key I sat and spoke to those inside of me They answered my questions with questions And they set me to stand on the brink Where the sun and the moon were as brothers And all that was left was to think They answered my questions with questions And they pointed me into the night And the power that bore me had left me alone To figure out which way was right
Manfred Mann's Earth Band,2utNxkLhreF1oIfO8kQT3q,Don't Kill It Carol,4uKnykXVVV1pHGCqvgsyqG, This wild rose that I hold in my hand It s the strangest thing I ve seen One bud only just started to show And the leaves are the lightest green It s had it s share of the rain It needs some feeling to light it s fiery flame again But one cruel lie and it could die Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol This wild rose that I hold in my hand It could grow to be so strong Born one night in the calm of the storm It was made for a rock and roll song It s only just seen the light It could so easily fall back to the gentle night But one cruel lie and it could die Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol It s looking for a place to live outside all space and time Where there s no need for it to fade There s a secret garden that I think we can find Lot s of sunshine there s a touch of shade Do nt kill it Carol This wild rose that I hold in my hand It s the strangest thing I ve seen One bud only just started to show And the leaves are the lightest green It s had it s share of the rain It needs some feeling to light it s fiery flame again But one cruel lie and it could die Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol Oh Carol oh wo nt you let this flower grow Do nt kill it Carol
