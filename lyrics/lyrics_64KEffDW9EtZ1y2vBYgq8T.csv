Marshmello,64KEffDW9EtZ1y2vBYgq8T,Happier,2dpaYNEQHiRxtZbfNsse99, Lately I ve been I ve been thinking I want you to be happier I want you to be happier When the morning comes When we see what we ve become In the cold light of day we re a flame in the wind Not the fire that we ve begun Every argument every word we ca nt take back Cause with all that has happened I think that we both know the way that the story ends Then only for a minute I want to change my mind Cause this just do nt feel right to me I want to raise your spirits I want to see you smile but Know that means I ll have to leave Know that means I ll have to leave Lately I ve been I ve been thinking I want you to be happier I want you to be happier When the evening falls And I m left there with my thoughts And the image of you being with someone else Well it s eating me up inside But we ran our course we pretended we re okay Now if we jump together at least we can swim Far away from the wreck we made Then only for a minute I want to change my mind Cause this just do nt feel right to me I want to raise your spirits I want to see you smile but Know that means I ll have to leave Know that means I ll have to leave Lately I ve been I ve been thinking I want you to be happier I want you to be happier So I ll go I ll go I will go go go So I ll go I ll go I will go go go Lately I ve been I ve been thinking I want you to be happier I want you to be happier Even though I might not like this I think that you ll be happier I want you to be happier Then only for a minute I want to change my mind Cause this just do nt feel right to me I want to raise your spirits I want to see you smile but Know that means I ll have to leave Know that means I ll have to leave Lately I ve been I ve been thinking I want you to be happier I want you to be happier So I ll go I ll go I will go go go
