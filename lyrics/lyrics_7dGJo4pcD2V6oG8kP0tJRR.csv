room give me some room give me the juice Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot Yall got ta move yall got ta move give me the juice Back on my bullshit my back to the wall Turn my back on you all of you finished Back to these bullets it s back to the job Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin Back on my hood shit it s back to the pushin These packs and I m actually pumpin Ca nt fuck

guys If I do nt kill you just know you gon suffer this time I ai nt no gangster but I got some bangers Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives Choppers and jammies a partridge a pear tree My twelve days of Christmas was nothin but lies I run at you hard like a sumo sumo They say I talk like a chulo chulo I live in Mars I m not Bruno woo Bitch I m a dog call me Cujo rah You play your cards I reverse on you all And I might just drop all like a Uno bup Cllate boca mejor maricn little puto and all of you culo They ve invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto Lookin for somethin I prolly can never find now Shit get relevant until the beef die down In truth a nigga just really want me tied down I ve been alone and I never needed nobody Just only me and my shawty I ll tell these niggas to lie down Keep all of the money I never wanted the lifestyle I just pray to God that my son ll be alright now I said ai nt no love for the other side Or anyone who ever want smoke Joyner When I die I m goin out as the underdog who never lost hope You in the wrong cab down the wrong path Nigga wrong way wrong road Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast I just bought a fuckin lawn mower I have said a lotta things in my day I admit it This is payback in a way I regret it that I did it I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get em Was nt in it for the trophies just the fuckin recognition Fuck s the difference I m that cracker bend the law fuck the rules Man I used to risk it all now I got too much to lose I been eatin long enough man my stomach should be full I just ate lick the plate my buffet lucky me Fuck you think woo I got a couple of mansions Still I do nt have any manners You got a couple of ghost writers But to these kids it do nt actually matter They re askin me What the fuck happened to hiphop I said I do nt have any answers Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album It hurt me like hell but I m back on these rappers And actually comin from humble beginnings I m somewhat uncomfortable winning I wish I could say What a wonderful feeling We re on the upswing like we re punchin the ceiling But nothin is sealing like anyone has any fuckin ability To even stick to a subject it s killin me The inability to pin humility Hatata batata why do nt we make a bunch of fuckin Songs about nothin and mumble And fuck it I m goin for the jugular Shit is a circus you clowns that are comin up Do nt give an ounce of a motherfuck About the ones that were here before you to make raps it s recap Way back MC s that wreak havoc on tape decks ADAT s with the G raps and Kane s hat We need 3 stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back Because half of these rappers have brain damage All the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap I do nt hate trap and I do nt wan na seem mad But in fact with a oldme at the same cat That would take that feedback and aim back I need that But I think it s inevitable They know a button to press or a lever to pull They give me the snap though bitch And if I payin attention I m probably makin it bigger But you ve been takin the dicks in the fuckin back ho get it On the brink in a minute Got me thinkin of finishin everything With acetaminophen then reapin the benefits I m asleep at the wheel again As I peak into thinkin about an evil intent Of another beat Ima kill again Cause even if I got ta end up eating a pill again Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram And I might as well cause Ima end up bein a villain again Levels to this shit I got an elevator You could never say to me I m not a fuckin record breaker I sound like a broken record every time I break a record Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made a navigator Motherfucker know I got a right to be this way I got spite inside my DNA But I wrote till the wheels fall off I m workin tirelessly ay It s the moment yall been waitin for Like California wishin rain would pour And that drought yall have been prayin for My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaws Still the same Marshall that outlaw That they say is a rider mighta fell off But back on that bull like the cowboys So yall got ta move yeah yall got ta move yeah yall got ta move Give me some room give me some room give me the juice Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot Yall got ta move yall got ta

bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonalds But if you re lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival But yall are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider Maybe the vocals should have been autotuned and you would have bought it But sayin I no longer got it cause you missed the line and never caught it Cause it went over your head because you re too stupid to get it Cause you re mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest With your expertise and knowledge but you ll never be an artist And I m harder on myself than you could ever be regardless What I ll never be is flawless all I ll ever be is honest Even when I m gone they re gon na say I brought it Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic With a bottle full of malt liquor But I could nt bottle this shit any longer The fact that I know that Ima hit my bottom if I dont Pull myself from the jaws of defeat And rise to my feet I do nt see why yall even started with me I get impeached My enemies die I do nt ceasefire till at least all are deceased I m eastside never be caught slippin Now you see why I do nt sleep Not even a wink I do nt blink I do nt doze off I do nt even nod to the beats I do nt even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze Aw man That BET cypher was

matter what I say Give me Donkey of the Day What a way for 2018 to get underway But I m gon na say everything that I wan na say Welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah Invite them in like a one a day I m not done preach Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand was it even worth it Cause the way I see people turnin Is makin it seem worthless It s startin to defeat the purpose I m watchin my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just trying to do the right thing but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined Cause I m determined to be me critique the worship But if I could go back I d at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he s deserted But I think it s workin These verses are makin him a wee bit nervous And he s too scared to answer me with words Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least he s heard it Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet in person To see if I really think of hurtin him Or ask if I m linked to terrorists I said Only when it comes to ink and lyricists But my beef is more media journalists Hold up hold up hold up I said my beef is more meaty a journalist They can get a mouthful of flesh And yes I mean eating a penis Cause they been panning my album to death So I been giving the media fingers Do nt wan na turn this to a counselling sesh But they been puttin me through the ringer So I ai nt ironin shit out with the press But I just took this beat to the cleaners
