Rodney Atkins,2qgvmDsc4jrqbAbjq1HGM2,Caught Up In The Country,2BgunkkepMPFpArQj1Dx5s, Square bales flatbeds Clothesline sunsets Sky blue barn red Wind chimes front porch Good dogs wood floors Work boots open doors And miles and miles of John Deere green Freedom far as I can see A road to run and room to breathe That s who I am and I ll always be Caught up in the country The only way I wan na be Somewhere where the road ends Out there where the creek bends That s where you can find me With them fields of gold and cotton rows That never ending sky I take it slow and easy roaming this life Caught up in the country Just look at em stars Must be a billion of em Just doing they thing Right where God put em If this ai nt heaven it s halfway there You can feel it in the air Caught up in the country The only way I wan na be Somewhere where the road ends Out there where the creek bends That s where you can find me With them fields of gold and cotton rows That never ending sky I take it slow and easy roaming this life Caught up in the country I was brought up in it Caught up in the country Oh and good Lord willin Yes I am my way I ll stay Caught up in it caught up in it Somewhere where the road ends Out there where the creek bends That s where you can find me With them fields of gold and cotton rows That never ending sky I take it slow and easy roaming this life Miles and miles of John Deere green Freedom far as I can see A road to run and room to breathe That s who I am and I ll always be Caught up in the country Caught up in the country Caught up in the country
