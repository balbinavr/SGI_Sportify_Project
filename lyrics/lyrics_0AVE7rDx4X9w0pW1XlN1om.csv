Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Lotus Blossom,33p7jMh4ThQdZ3fe6scpfI, So empty like sky Without any sun Lotus Blossom do nt cry You and I were meant to be one And though we re apart It wo nt be for long I come to you In my song So happy we two Like sparrows in spring Lotus Blossom it s true Me and you like bow upon string I live for the day My journey will end So I can touch you again And in my dream You are always there with me A Tahitian fantasy But then the film just breaks And I wake Lotus Blossom So empty like sky Without any sun Lotus Blossom do nt cry You and I were meant to be one And though we re apart It wo nt be for long I come to you In my song

Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Down In Brazil,1nwbs28yvHMwh89fEKaDTl, Down in Brazil It takes a day to walk a mile Time just stand still And when the people you meet look at you they smile They still believe in style They serve you with their sambas til You really know you re down in ol Brazil You can tell you re down in ol Brazil Down in Brazil They ve never heard of win or lose If you ca nt feel Then all those cafe ole girls in high heel shoes Will really cure your blues It seems they all just aim to please Those women sway like wind in my banana trees Then you know you re down in ol Brazil Down in Brazil They know a million ways to play You start to feel And when you re happy It s the same as when you pray You d think you get away Then you know you never will Now when you ve been down in ol Brazil Now when you are down in ol Brazil Down in ol Brazil Down in ol Brazil Down in ol Brazil Down in ol Brazil
Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Nightmoves,4sbQeadjoK4F1ABB91iyvt, The music begins And the titles fade in Starring you and me The hero is struggling to say That his lady is far away In her prison of wishes We love and we fight But it s all Day For Night Just a Masquerade We reel till the red light is off Then we go take our faces off Like two clowns in a sideshow Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream Just another technicolor romance on the screen Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream Just another technicolor romance on the screen I keep you in frame And I whisper your name Till the picture fades The feeling is already gone I do nt know why am I going on Ca nt remember the ending
Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Antonio's Song (The Rainbow),3MTqRu66bdSzdOv08owKS6, Antonio lives life s frevo Antonio prays for truth Antonio says our friendship Is a hundredproof The vulture that circles Rio Hangs in this LA sky The blankets they give the Indians Only make them die But sing the Song Forgotten for so long And let the Music flow Like Light into the Rainbow We know the Dance we have We still have the chance To break these chains and flow Like Light into the Rainbow Antonio loves the desert Antonio prays for rain Antonio knows that Pleasure Is the child of Pain And lost in La Califusa When most of my hope was gone Antonio s samba led me To the Amazon We sing the Song Forgotten for so long And let the music flow Like Light into the Rainbow We know the Dance we have We still have the chance To break these chains and flow Like Light into the Rainbow
Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Read My Lips,68LFkY4TMwgKqfOtnNEZ1j, Read my lips It must be obvious I love you Read my lips It must be obvious Read my lips Though I ca nt tell you that I love you Read my lips It must be obvious Hard as I try to fight it Anything can excite it Merely the meeting of our eyes It just intensifies I soon loose my senses I got no defenses There ai nt nothin I can do Except to stare at you You got the secret combination to my heart If you want to take it all please do Infatuation is just tearing me apart I do nt dig secrecy I ca nt wait til the day we re both free It must be obvious I love you But you know loose talk sinks ships Though I ca nt tell you that I love you In public read my lips You know who s my witness The first day at fitness When I saw your sultry shape And there was no escape You set off my siren I kept pumping iron But all that my eyes would do Was only stare at you
Michael Franks,0AVE7rDx4X9w0pW1XlN1om,Eggplant,3Fql2MRthqXoQGgDlw6cZJ, Whenever I explore the land of Yin I always take one on the chin And now this lioness has almost made me tame I ca nt pronounce her name but eggplant is her game The lady sticks to me like white on rice She never cooks the same way twice Maybe it s the mushrooms Maybe the tomatoes I ca nt reveal her name but eggplant is her game When my baby cooks her eggplant She do nt read no book She s got a Gioconda kinda of dirty look And my baby cooks her eggplant About 19 different ways Sometimes I just have it raw with mayonnaise Maybe it s the way she grates her cheese Or just the freckles on her knees Maybe it s the scallions Maybe she s Italian I ca nt reveal her name but eggplant is her game When my baby cooks her eggplant She do nt read no book She s got a Gioconda kinda of dirty look And my baby cooks her eggplant About 19 different ways Sometimes I just have it raw with mayonnaise
