Jeremy Zucker,3gIRvgZssIb9aiirIg0nI3,Idk Love,2mSrVZsSKn2Ye5f0YuAbMh, With the summer sun over us I never thought that I could feel this blind Remembering how I would give a fuck Stressing out because I wanted time Now I m pouring out an hourglass Waiting for the wind to carry me I wish the sun would go and hide away Cause I ve just been dying for rain And lately I do nt feel the same Though I ve been trying to I do nt know love no more I do nt know love no more It s easier when you know You ll be fine on your own But I do nt know love no more I do nt know love no more You say that you know this road But you do nt know difficult You will call me when you need it call it when it s convenient for ya You do nt know the way you control me Act like you do nt see it spill an ocean of secrets and ya Hold me down and hope I wo nt drown til I do nt know love no more And I do nt know love no more It s easier cuz I know Ill be fine on my own But I do nt know love no more I do nt know love no more You say that you know this road But you do nt know difficult I do nt know love I do nt know love I do nt know love
