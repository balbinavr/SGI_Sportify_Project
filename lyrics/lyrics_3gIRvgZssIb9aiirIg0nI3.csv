Jeremy Zucker,3gIRvgZssIb9aiirIg0nI3,all the kids are depressed,75ls0gurX68lUmMjE7QcsE, How long have you been smiling It seems like it s been too long Some days I do nt feel like trying So what the fuck are you on I think too much we drink too much Falling in love like it s just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing s wrong Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I m not feeling alright Staying up til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I do nt know what happened My natural reaction is that we re scared So I guess we re scared No I ca nt really keep lying Cause I ve been scared all along I m getting sick of sleeping in While all my friends are popping pills And I do nt think that they re wrong I think too much we drink too much Falling apart like it s just nothing And I want to know where do we go When nothing s wrong Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I m not feeling alright Staying up til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I do nt know what happened My natural reaction is that we re scared So I guess we re scared I wo nt deny it cause you saw what it was I ca nt deny it if you wo nt give a fuck So I ll sew it up You know I am so in love
