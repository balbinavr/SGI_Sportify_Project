"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,Almost Cut My Hair,0gCJkpD0RhF2rjiALLHBQL, Almost cut my hair It happened just the other day It was gettin kind of long I coulda said it was in my way But I did nt and I wonder why I feel like letting my freak flag fly Yes I feel like I owe it to someone Must be because I had the flu for Christmas And I m not feeling up to par It increases my paranoia Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car But I m not giving in an inch to fear Cause I ve promised myself this year I feel like I owe it to someone Woo When I finally get myself together I m gon na get down in that sunny southern weather And I find a space inside to laugh Separate the wheat from the chaff I feel like I owe it to someone yeah
"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,Teach Your Children,29HaKOpeLSYvqdFyEQSRdj, You who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by And so become yourself Because the past is just a goodbye Teach your children well Their father s hell did slowly go by And feed them on your dreams The one they picked the one you ll know by Do nt you ever ask them why If they told you you would cry So just look at them back inside And know they love you And you of tender years Ca nt know the fears that your elders grew by And so please help them with your youth They seek the truth before they can die Teach your parents well Their children s hell will slowly go by And feed them on your dreams The one they picked the one you ll know by Do nt you ever ask them why If they told you you would cry So just look at them back inside And know they love you

"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,Helpless,3gQMqeXqiHFCafaTtFnHF8, There is a town in north Ontario With dream comfort memory to spare And in my mind I still need a place to go All my changes were there Blue blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave us Helpless helpless helpless Baby can you hear me now Helpless helpless helpless The chains are locked and tied across the door Helpless helpless helpless Baby sing with me somehow Helpless helpless helpless Blue blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave us Helpless Helpless Helpless
"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,Woodstock,2iqKVzMZpyUVPwxIVaQkhm, Well I came upon a child of God He was walking along the road And I asked him tell me where are you going This he told me Said I m going down to Yasgur s Farm Gon na join in a rock and roll band Got to get back to the land And set my soul free We are stardust we are golden We are billionyearold carbon And we ve got to get ourselves Back to the garden Well then can I walk beside you I have come to lose the smog And I feel myself a cog In somethin turning And maybe it s the time of year Yes and maybe it s the time of man And I do nt know who I am But life is for learning We are stardust we are golden We are billionyearold carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden We are stardust we are golden We are billionyearold carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden By the time we got to Woodstock We were half a million strong And everywhere was a song And a celebration And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes Riding shotgun in the sky Turning into butterflies Above our nation We are stardust we are golden We are caught in the devil s bargain And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden
"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,4 + 20,2jZPEeW2ynykb2GkVqpOkJ, Four and Twenty years ago I come into this life Son of a woman And a man who lived in strife He was tired of being poor And he was nt into selling door to door And he worked like a devil to be more A different kind of poverty now upsets me so Night after sleepless night I walk the floor and want to know Why am I so alone Where is my woman can I bring her home Have I driven her away Is she gone Morning comes the sunrise And I m driven to my bed I see that it is empty And there s devils in my head I embrace the many colored beast I grow weary of the torment Can there be no peace And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease
"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1CYsQCypByMVgnv17qsSbQ,Deja Vu,3O4VF8UYD6CCuhj6d4TQPa, If I had ever been here before I would probably know just what todo Do nt you If I had ever been here before on another time around the wheel I would probably know just how to deal With all of you And I feel Like I ve been here before Feel Like I ve been here before And you know It makes me wonder What s going on under the ground Do you know Do nt you wonder What s going on down under you We have all been here before We have all been here before We have all been here before We have all been here before
