Bob Seger,485uL27bPomh29R4JmQehQ,Night Moves,6UBjSnyP1O5W5ndJoO9vUk, I was a little too tall could ve used a few pounds Tight pants points hardly renowned She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes And points all her own sitting way up high Way up firm and high Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy Out in the back seat of my 60 Chevy Workin on mysteries without any clues Workin on our night moves Trying make some frontpage drivein news Workin on our night moves In the summertime Mm in the sweet summertime We were nt in love oh no far from it We were nt searching for some high in the sky summit We were just young and restless and bored Living by the sword And we d steal away every chance we could To the backrooms an alley or trusty woods I used her she used me but neither one cared We were getting our share Workin on our night moves Trying to lose some awkward teenage blues Workin on our night moves mm And it was summertime Mm sweet summertime summertime Oh the wonderin I felt the lightning yeah Waited on the thunder Waited on the thunder I woke last night to the sound of thunder How far off I sat and wondered Started humming a song from 1962 Ai nt it funny how the night moves When you just do nt seem to have as much to lose Strange how the night moves With autumn closing in Mm night moves Mm night moves Night moves Night moves Yeah Night moves I remember Night moves Ah I sure remember the night moves Night moves Ai nt it funny how you remember Night moves Funny how you remember Night moves I remember I remember I remember I remember Night moves Whoa whoa whoa Night moves Remember working working and practicing Night moves Working and practicing Night moves Oh for the night moves night moves Night moves Oh Night moves I remember yeah yeah yeah Night moves I remember ooh Night moves I remember Lord I remember Lord I remember Night moves Ho oh Ooh ooh Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah Uhhuh uhhuh I remember I remember

Bob Seger,485uL27bPomh29R4JmQehQ,Against The Wind,1SWmFiFSIBoDbQJjNKC7SR, Seems like yesterday But it was long ago Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights There in darkness with the radio playin low And the secrets that we shared Mountains that we moved Caught like a wildfire out of control Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove And I remember what she said to me How she swore that it never would end I remember how she held me oh so tight Wish I did nt know now what I did nt know then Against the wind We were running against the wind We were young and strong We were running against the wind The years rolled slowly past And I found myself alone Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends Found myself further and further from my home and I Guess I lost my way There were oh so many roads I was livin to run and running to live Never worried about payin or even how much I owe Movin eight miles a minute for months at a time Breakin all of the rules that would bend I began to find myself searchin Searchin for shelter again and again Against the wind Little somethin against the wind I found myself seekin shelter against the wind Well those drifters days are past me now I ve got so much more to think about Deadlines and commitments What to leave in what to leave out Against the wind I m still running against the wind I m older now but still running against the wind Well I m older now and still running Against the wind Against the wind Against the wind Still running Against the wind I m still running against the wind Against the wind I m still running Against the wind I m still running against the wind Against the wind Still running Against the wind Running against the wind running against the wind Against the wind See the young man run Against the wind Watch the young man run Against the wind Watch the young man runin Against the wind He ll be runnin against the wind Against the wind Let the cowboys ride Against the wind Against the wind Let the cowboys ride Against the wind They ll be ridin against the wind Against the wind Against the wind Against the wind Ridin against the wind Against the wind Against the wind

Bob Seger,485uL27bPomh29R4JmQehQ,Hollywood Nights,5VbePtZp1at8gH990zVyTI, She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast He was a midwestern boy on his own She looked at him with those soft eyes so innocent and blue He knew right then he was too far from home He was too far from home She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach They watched the waves tumble over the sand They drove for miles and miles up those twisting turning roads Higher and higher and higher they climbed And those Hollywood nights In those Hollywood hills She was looking so right In her diamonds and frills All those big city nights In those high rolling hills Above all the lights She had all of the skills He d headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good See some old friends good for the soul She had been born with a face that would let her get her way He saw that face and he lost all control He had lost all control Night after night day after day it went on and on Then came that morning he woke up alone He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA Wondering if he could ever go home And those Hollywood nights In those Hollywood hills It was looking so right It was giving him chills In those big city nights In those high rolling hills Above all the lights With a passion that kills In those Hollywood nights In those Hollywood hills She was looking so right In her diamonds and frills All those big city lights In those high rolling hills Above all the lights She had all of the skills
Bob Seger,485uL27bPomh29R4JmQehQ,Mainstreet,0XVR94voJPToKX1XoOw0ot, I remember standing on the corner at midnight Trying to get my courage up There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown Loved to watch her do her stuff Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet In the pool halls the hustlers and the losers Used to watch em through the glass Well I d stand outside at closing time Just to watch her walk on past Unlike all the other ladies she looked so young and sweet As she made her way alone down that empty street Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet Sometimes even now when I m feeling lonely and beat I drift back in time and I find my feet Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet Down on Mainstreet

Bob Seger,485uL27bPomh29R4JmQehQ,Roll Me Away,3MqgFVRerrpqWHdRopk247, Took a look down a westbound road Right away I made my choice Headed out to my big twowheeler I was tired of my own voice Took a bead on the northern plains And just rolled that power on Twelve hours out of Mackinac City Stopped in a bar to have a brew Met a girl and we had a few drinks And I told her what I d decided to do She looked out the window a long long moment Then she looked into my eyes She did nt have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin Roll roll me away Wo nt you roll me away tonight I too am lost I feel doublecrossed And I m sick of what s wrong and what s right We never even said a word We just walked out and got on that bike And we rolled And we rolled clean out of sight We rolled across the high plains Deep into the mountains Felt so good to me Finally feelin free Somewhere along a high road The air began to turn cold She said she missed her home I headed on alone Stood alone on a mountain top Starin out at the Great Divide I could go east I could go west It was all up to me to decide Just then I saw a young hawk flyin And my soul began to rise And pretty soon My heart was singin Roll roll me away I m gon na roll me away tonight Got ta keep rollin got ta keep ridin Keep searchin till I find what s right And as the sunset faded I spoke To the faintest first starlight And I said next time Next time We ll get it right
