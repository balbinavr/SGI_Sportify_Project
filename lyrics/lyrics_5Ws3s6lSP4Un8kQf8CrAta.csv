Susan Tedeschi,5Ws3s6lSP4Un8kQf8CrAta,Back To The River,2DMnCy43xnMVX2eglYtn6R, Wake in a cold sweat Nightmare by my bed Waiting for the rider Wondering through my head Cause I m a long way from home On the highway too long Got road dust in my mouth I need to head down south And get back to the river Back to the river Oh back to the river Back to the river to take my time So I can think about the little ones Keep them in my heart Born in a bad storm A nt no good when we re apart Well I m miss their hugs And chasing lighting bugs They make me smile but it s gon na take a little while To get back to the river Back to the river Oh back to the river Oh back to the river to take my time There s a full moon rising out tonight Might make be crazy but that all right Long as I find som peace of mine I m going back to the river to take my time Where there s a campfire going Warm breezes blowing Mose hanging from the trees I ll have all that I need When I get back to the river Oh back to the river Back to the river Oh back to the river Oh back now Oh lord I gota gota get back Lord lord back now Back to the river Oh back to the river right now Oh oh
