Kay Starr,7rpf45DdbpweG51Acze45i,Wheel Of Fortune,3KtnPUzGKb77Tnr8FhN8Fe, The wheel of fortune Goes spinning around Will the arrow point my way Will this be my day Oh wheel of fortune Please do nt pass me by Let me know the magic of A kiss and a sigh While the wheel is spining spinning spinning I ll not dream of winning fortune or fame While the wheel is turning turning turning I ll be yearning yearning for love s precious flame Oh wheel of fortune I m hoping somehow If you ll ever smile on me Please let it be now While the wheel is spining spinning spinning I ll not dream of winning fortune or even fame While the wheel is turning turning turning I ll be yearning yearning for love s precious flame Oh wheel of fortune I m hoping somehow If you ever smile on me Please let it be now

Kay Starr,7rpf45DdbpweG51Acze45i,Changing Partners,6mKjAV7VaVykuYCJilT9oZ, We were waltzin together to a dreamy melody When they called out Change partners And you waltzed away from me Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor And I ll keep on changing partners Till I hold you once more Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part In that wonderful moment somethin happened to my heart So I ll keep changing partners till you re in my arms and then Oh my darlin I will never change partners again Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part In that wonderful moment somethin happened to my heart So I ll keep changing partners till you re in my arms and then Oh my darlin I will never change partners again
