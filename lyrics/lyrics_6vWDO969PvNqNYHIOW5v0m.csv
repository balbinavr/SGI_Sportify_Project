Beyonc,6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m,Perfect Duet (Ed Sheeran & Beyonc),1bhUWB0zJMIKr9yVPrkEuI, I found a love for me Oh darling just dive right in and follow my lead Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet Oh I never knew you were the someone waitin for me Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowin what it was I will not give you up this time But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own And in your eyes you re holding mine Baby I m dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight Well I found a man stronger than anyone I know He shares my dreams I hope that someday we ll share a home I found a love to carry more than just my secrets To carry love to carry children of our own We are still kids but we re so in love Fightin against all odds I know we ll be alright this time Darling just hold my hand Be your girl you ll be my man And I see my future in your eyes Well baby I m dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful I do nt deserve this darling you look perfect tonight Baby I m dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass while listenin to our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel in person And she looks perfect and he looks perfect No I do nt deserve this You look perfect tonight
