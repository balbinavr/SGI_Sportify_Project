Phora,5XDJlfdfbGNJrOJJNxTcdq,Sinner Pt. 3 (feat. Vicktor Taiw),38Opd4SKonWLffsNDW9zK5, Yeah See it s been hard for me to be myself I look in the mirror and I ca nt see myself Feel like I m screaming and no one s hearing me Trapped in my insecurities knowing I could nt free myself I see you My heart and my time are two things I stopped giving Cause most of us are breathing but we not living What happens then when I m too numb inside to even feel What happens when there s no more life in me for you to kill I see you I ca nt love now I ca nt trust now I ca nt help but drinking to feel the rush now I ca nt lose you I ca nt keep you I ca nt stay but you know I m too weak to leave you I see you Know I m too weak to love someone else cause you know I need you Even though you lie to me I still try to believe you But we ended up as the type of people that do nt love Cause we grew up in a world that just never showed love I see you But if you see me now you would nt recognize me All these feelings that I used to have are dead inside me And I do nt know how much longer I can stay The ones that hold close are the ones that just push away I see you And it s like having trouble finding myself I could nt say I m still the same I could nt lie to myself They say love has a price we just ca nt afford what it cost Looking for ourselves in a place where we re all lost I see you running into the woods With your bright yellow jacket You look lost Yeah you look lost I see you running into the woods With your bright yellow jacket You look lost Yeah you look lost I see you Yeah my family do nt know the shit I ve been going through I m empty now and it s been a while since I ve spoke to you I run to you because I know your soul has been broken too But maybe that s the reason why I just could nt get close to you I see you You re no good your love is dressed in destruction I pushed away but without you I could nt function I needed something to feel I just needed something that s real Cause I just keep numbing the pain til I feel nothing in these I see you Nightmares haunt me still but I just keep dreaming If God exists tell me why I only see demons Yeah I only see demons Trying not to choke and my lungs fill with smoke like how the fuck I keep breathing I see you We live in a time where love is more painful than hate now So all the smiles we give to people are fake now And we just hide how we feel so we never break down And all these doubts got me feeling like a mistake now I see you I wish I did nt have to take these pills But I just needed something that can make me feel I just needed something that could take what s real And make me numb cause all this pain just ca nt be killed I see you I ca nt be killed my soul s too real that s when it broke to pieces Who would have thought that loving you was my only weakness Fuck who would have thought that loving you was my only weakness I see you running into the woods With your bright yellow jacket You look lost Yeah you look lost I see you running into the woods With your bright yellow jacket You look lost Yeah you look lost I see you
