The J. Geils Band,69Mj3u4FTUrpyeGNSIaU6F,Monkey Island,45uZ6hG17DHvP2VqPvyo57, No one could explain it What went on that night How every living thing Just dropped out of sight We watched them take the bodies And row them back to shore Nothing like that ever Happened here before On the east side of the island Not too far from the shore There stood the old house Of fifty years or more All the doors and windows Were locked inside and out The fate of those trapped in there Would never be found out There ai nt no life on Monkey Island No one cares and no one knows The moon hangs out on Monkey Island The night has dealt the final blow The fish jumped from the water And started walking home The birds all started screaming And dove into the foam The night came out of nowhere And then a quiet rain Footsteps in the darkness Down a half forgotten road There ai nt no life on Monkey Island No one cares and no one knows The moon hangs out on Monkey Island The night has dealt the final blow There ai nt no life on Monkey Island The night has dealt the final blow There ai nt no life on Monkey Island No one cares and no one knows The moon hangs out on Monkey Island The night has dealt the final blow There ai nt no life on Monkey Island No one cares and no one knows The moon hangs out on Monkey Island The night has dealt the final blow
