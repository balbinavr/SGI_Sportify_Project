Lauv,5JZ7CnR6gTvEMKX4g70Amv,There's No Way (feat. Julia Michaels),2hnxrRNzF74mdDzpQZQukQ, You touch me and it s almost like we knew That there will be history between us two We knew someday that we would have regrets But we just ignored them the night we met We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered You touch me and it s almost like we knew That there will be history There s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other There s no way that it s not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But there s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other I wish I could make the time stop So we could forget everything and everyone I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in to what we want Cause when I got somebody you dont And when you got somebody I dont I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in There s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other There s no way that it s not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But there s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered You touched me and it s almost like we knew That there would be history There s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other There s no way that it s not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we can hold off one sec So we can keep this tension in check But there s no way that it s not going there With the way that we re looking at each other We just keep on dancing right into each other We just keep on dancing right into each other
