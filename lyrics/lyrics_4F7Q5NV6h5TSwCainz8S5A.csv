Duke Ellington,4F7Q5NV6h5TSwCainz8S5A,In A Sentimental Mood,0E8q2Fx2XuzXCO2NSAppkR, In A Sentimental Mood I can see The stars come through my room While your loving attitude is Like a flame that lights the gloom On the wings of evry kiss Drift a melody so strange and sweet In this sentimental bliss you make My Paradise complete Rose pearls seem to fall It s all like a dream to call you mine My heart s lighter thing since you Made me this night a thing divine In A Sentimental Mood I m within a world so heavenly For I never dreamt that you d be Loving sentimental me In A Sentimental Mood I can see The stars come through my room While your loving attitude is Like a flame that lights the gloom On the wings of evry kiss Drift a melody so strange and sweet In this sentimental bliss you make My Paradise complete Rose pearls seem to fall It s all like a dream to call you mine My heart s lighter thing since you Made me this night a thing divine In A Sentimental Mood I m within a world so heavenly For I never dreamt that you d be Loving sentimental me
Duke Ellington,4F7Q5NV6h5TSwCainz8S5A,My Little Brown Book,4rmCI9VWrwrJTJ8XQ80BMN, My little brown book With the silver binding How it keeps reminding me Of a memory That s haunting me In some quiet nook I go through its pages And peruse this ageless tale Of a love that failed To ever become true On this page is the date Of that fateful night at eight When I found you were no longer in love After that there s nothing more Just a dark and futile door That shuts out the stars above In my little book I inscribed your heart vow But since we re apart now This and that last sweet kiss Is all that s left of you Is all that s left of you
Duke Ellington,4F7Q5NV6h5TSwCainz8S5A,"Take the ""A"" Train",6KBsivP3Of4z2x6uNMAyE3, You must take the A train To go to Sugar Hill way up in Harlem If you miss the A train You ll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem Hurry get on now it s coming Listen to those rails ahumming All aboard get on the A train Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem

Duke Ellington,4F7Q5NV6h5TSwCainz8S5A,Azalea,02Z7LG6DNTuVTJiGdvTwDu, It was such a fine spring day Down Lousiana way With fragrance divine And such magnificent regalia Oh so fine Azalea Oh what a lovely sight In red pink and white Ca nt help but believe That nothing evil can assail you So naive Azalea You re at ease on the knees Of the moss covered trees Whose tops meet to make a high ceiling In the churchlike pomp Of the cypress swamp I ve yet to get that same strange feeling I ve got to go back there And find that blossom fair I always dream of Cause with you who could be a failure My first love Azalea
