Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,Black Coffee,56IQUfsUskt9VHe6YM6kue, I m feelin mighty lonesome Have nt slept a wink I walk the floor from nine to four In between I drink Black coffee Love s a handmedown brew I ll never know a Sunday in this weekday room I m talkin to the shadows One oclock till four And Lord how slow the moments go When all I do is pour Black coffee Since the blues caught my eye I m hangin out on Monday my Sunday dreams to dry Now man is born to come alovin And a woman s born to weep and fret To stay at home and tend her oven And down her past regrets In coffee and cigarettes I m moanin all the mornin Moanin all the night And in between it s nicotine And not much heart to fight Black coffee Feelin low as the ground It s drivin me crazy This waitin for my baby Till he come around till he come around
Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,Tenderly,6TMoKdGcSIHjLfyzINFB5X, Walter Gross Jack Lawrence The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly Then you and I came wandering by And lost in a sigh were we The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly I ca nt forget how two hearts met breathlessly Your arms opened wide and closed me inside You took my lips you took my love so tenderly
Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,Mean to Me,6Q7U4bTozx5kfLjWT81u7P, You re mean to me Why must you be mean to me Gee honey it seems to me You love to see me cryin I do nt know why I stay home each night When you say you phone You do nt and I m left alone Sing the blues and sighin You treat me coldly each day in the year You always scold me Whenever somebody is near dear I must be great fun to be mean to me You should nt for ca nt you see What you mean to me
Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,He's My Guy,5Po3D0fxlUpQTciXYWOmnJ, In this world of ordinary people Extraordinary people I m glad there is you In this world of overrated pleasures Of underrated treasures I m so glad there is you I live to love I love to live with you beside me This role so new I ll muddle through with you to guide me In this world where many many play at love And hardly any stay in love I m glad there is you In this world where many many play at love And hardly any stay in love I m glad there is you More than ever I m glad there is you
Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,Misty,7gHFBNy0Qn86xGKJ9OdFTw, Look at me I m as helpless as a kitten up a tree And I feel like I m clingin to a cloud I can t understand I get misty just holding your hand Walk my way And a thousand violins begin to play Or it might be the sound of your hello That music I hear I get misty the moment you re near You can say that you re leading me on But it s just what I want you to do Do nt you notice how hopelessly I m lost That s why I m following you On my own Would I wander through this wonderland alone Never knowing my right foot from my left My hat from my glove I m too misty and too much in love I m just too misty And too much In love
Sarah Vaughan,1bgyxtWjZwA5PQlDsvs9b8,Lullaby Of Birdland,5z161QQZMgQxSILnv3QoJk, Lullaby of birdland That s what I Always hear when you sigh Never in my wordland Could there be ways to reveal In a phrase how I feel Have you ever heard two turtledoves Bill and coo When they love That s the kind of magic music We make with our lips When we kiss And there s a weapy ol willow He really knows how to cry That s how I ll cry on my pillow If you should tell me Farewell and goodbye Lullaby of birdland Whisper low Kiss me sweet and we ll go Flying high in birdland High in the sky up above All because we re in love
