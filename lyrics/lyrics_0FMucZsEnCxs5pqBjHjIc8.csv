Stan Getz,0FMucZsEnCxs5pqBjHjIc8,Corcovado,7KsQssGg3DaovFkd9Kbnc6, Quiet nights of quiet stars Quiet chords from my guitar Floating on the silence that surrounds us Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams Quiet walks by quiet streams And a window that looks out on Corcovado Oh how lovely Um cantinho um violao Esse amor uma cancao Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama Muita calma pra pensar E ter tempo pra sonhar Da janela vese o Corcovado O Redentor que lindo x2 Quero a vida sempre assim Com voce perto de mim Ate o apagar da velha chama E eu que era triste Descrente desse mundo Ao encontrar voce eu conheci O que e felicidade meu amor
Stan Getz,0FMucZsEnCxs5pqBjHjIc8,The Girl From Ipanema,6n50vexd6yBNvSOc6QHT5X, Ting toong dung bwling gng gung Bwling gng gung Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graa ela a menina que vem e que passa Num doce balano a caminho do mar Moa do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema O seu balanado mais que um poema a coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar Ah porque estou to sozinho Ah porque tudo e to triste Ah a beleza que existe A beleza que no s minha Que tambm passa sozinha Ah se ela soubesse que quando ela passa O mundo sorrindo se enche de graa E fica mais lindo por causa do amor Tall and tan and young and lovely The girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes Each one she passes goes Aaah When she walks she s like a samba That swings so cool and sways so gently That when she passes Each one she passes goes Aaah Oh but he watch her so sadly How can he tell her he loves her Yes he would give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tan and young and lovely The girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes He smiles But she does nt see Musical Interlude Oh but he sees her so sadly How can he tell her he loves her Yes he would give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tan and young and lovely The girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes He smiles But she doesn t see She just doesn t see No she doesn t see But she doesn t see She doesn t see No she doesn t see
