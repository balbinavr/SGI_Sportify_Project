"Hank Williams, Jr.",2dyeCWctcFRt3Pha76ONgb,A Country Boy Can Survive,77dcKrzRUI02XjHd2okARp, The preacher man says it s the end of time And the Mississippi River she s agoin dry The interest is up and the stock market s down And you only get mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods you see My woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun a rifle and a fourwheel drive And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive I can plow a field all day long I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn Yeah We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too Ai nt too many things these old boys ca nt do We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive Because you ca nt stomp us out and you ca nt make us run Cause we re them old boys raised on shotguns We say grace and we say maam If you ai nt into that we do nt give a damn We came from the West Virginia coal mines And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies And we can skin a buck we can run a trotline And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive I had a good friend in New York City He never called me by my name just Hillbilly My grandpa taught me how to live off the land And his taught him to be a businessman He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights And I d send him some homemade wine But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife For fortythree dollars my friend lost his life I d love to spit some BeechNut in that dude s eyes And shoot him with my old fortyfive Cause a country boy can survive Country folks can survive Cause you ca nt stomp us out and you ca nt make us run Cause we re them old boys raised on shotguns We say grace and we say maam If you ai nt into that we do nt give a damn We re from north California and south Alabam And little towns all around this land And we can skin a buck we can run a trotline And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive A country boy can survive Country folks can survive
"Hank Williams, Jr.",2dyeCWctcFRt3Pha76ONgb,Family Tradition,73ZTWCuwudUVvvWipRnQnQ, Country music singers Have always been a real close family But lately some of my kinfolks Have disowned a few others and me I guess it s because I kind of changed my direction Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition They get on me and want to know Hank Why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke Why must you live out the songs that you wrote Over and over Everybody makes my prediction So if I get stoned I m just carrying on An old family tradition I am very proud Of my daddy s name Although his kind of music And mine ai nt exactly the same Stop and think it over Put yourself in my position If I get stoned and sing all night long It s a family tradition Do nt ask me Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke Why must you live out the songs that you wrote If I m down in a honkytonk And some ol slick s tryin to give me friction I ll say leave me alone I m singing all night long It s a family tradition Lordy I have loved some ladies And I have loved Jim Beam And they both tried to kill me in 1973 When that doctor asked me Son how did you get in this condition I said Hey sawbones I m just carryin on an ol family tradition So do nt ask me Hank why do you drink Hank why do roll smoke Why must you live out the songs that you wrote Stop and think it over Try and put yourself in my unique position If I get stoned and sing all night long it s a family tradition
