Nancy Wilson,2JfVCMa3FlvQRlLT5uH9zb,The Masquerade Is Over,1jf3wYtynxiPOdhqAp3cUN, Your eyes do nt shine like they used to shine And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine I m afraid the masquerade is over And so is love and so is love Your words do nt mean what they used to mean They were once inspired now they re just routine I m afraid the masquerade is over And so is love and so is love I guess I ll have to play Pagliacci And get myself a clown s disguise And then I ll learn to laugh like Pagliacci With tears in my eyes You look you look the same you re a lot the same But my heart says No no you re not the same I m afraid the masquerade is over all over And so is love and so is love It s all over and so is love
Nancy Wilson,2JfVCMa3FlvQRlLT5uH9zb,I Wish You Love,7moJWeYfMTr7iWgSHvwF7Y, I wish you bluebirds in the spring to give your heart a song to sing And then a kiss but more than this I wish you love And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade I wish you health and more than wealth I wish you love My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be So with my best my very best I set you free I wish you shelter from the storm A cozy fire to keep you warm But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be So with my best my very best I set you free I wish you shelter from the storm A cozy fire to keep you warm But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love I wish you love I wish you love
Nancy Wilson,2JfVCMa3FlvQRlLT5uH9zb,The Boy From Ipanema,2chTka18XL8un05Pkb8Lis, Tall and tan and young and handsome The Boy From Ipanema goes walking And when he passes Each girl he passes goes ah When he walks he s like a samba That swings so cool and sways so gently That when he passes Each girl he passes goes ah Oh but I watch him so sadly How can I tell him I love him Yes I would give his heart gladly But each day when he walks to the sea He looks straight ahead not at me Tall and tan and young and handsome The Boy From Ipanema goes walking And when he passes I smile But he does nt see Oh but I watch him so sadly How can I tell him I love him Yes I would give heart gladly But each day when he walks to the sea He looks straight ahead not at me Tall and tan and young and handsome The Boy From Ipanema goes walking And when he passes I smile But he does nt see He does nt see me He does nt see
