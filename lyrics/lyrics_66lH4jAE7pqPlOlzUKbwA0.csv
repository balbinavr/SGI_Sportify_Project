Miranda Lambert,66lH4jAE7pqPlOlzUKbwA0,The House That Built Me,02eD9ymfJOJOhM97HYp5R9, I know they say you ca nt go home again I just had to come back one last time Maam I know you do nt know me from Adam But these handprints on the front steps are mine And up those stairs in that little back bedroom Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar And I bet you did nt know under that live oak My favorite dog is buried in the yard I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing Out here it s like I m someone else I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in I swear I ll leave Wo nt take nothing but a memory From the house that built me Mama cut out pictures of houses for years From Better Homes and Garden magazines Plans were drawn concrete poured And nail by nail and board by board Daddy gave life to mama s dream I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing Out here it s like I m someone else I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in I swear I ll leave Wo nt take nothing but a memory From the house that built me You leave home you move on and you do the best you can I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing Out here it s like I m someone else I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could walk around I swear I ll leave Wo nt take nothing but a memory From the house that built me
Miranda Lambert,66lH4jAE7pqPlOlzUKbwA0,Mama's Broken Heart,2mXsZsJBThTaJXbNcg5QD4, I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors I screamed his name til the neighbors called the cops I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver Do nt know what I did next all I know I could nt stop Word got around to the barflies and the baptists My mama s phone started ringin off the hook I can hear her now sayin she ai nt gon na have it Do nt matter how you feel it only matters how you look Go and fix your make up girl it s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady Cause I raised you better got ta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ai nt my mama s broken heart Wish I could be just a little less dramatic Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames Leave it to me to be holdin the matches When the fire trucks show up and there s nobody else to blame Ca nt get revenge and keep a spotless reputation Sometimes revenge is a choice you got ta make My mama came from a softer generation Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face Go and fix your make up girl it s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady Cause I raised you better got ta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ai nt my mama s broken heart Powder your nose paint your toes Line your lips and keep em closed Cross your legs dot your is And never let em see you cry Go and fix your make up when it s just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady Cause I raised you better got ta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ai nt my mama s broken heart

Miranda Lambert,66lH4jAE7pqPlOlzUKbwA0,Automatic,0B0y2FImat9j9MJTNRZWfW, Quarter in a payphone Drying laundry on the line Watching Sun Tea in the window Pocket Watch tellin time Seems like only yesterday I d get a blank cassette Record the country countdown cause I could nt buy it yet If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress We d take along a Rand McNally stand in line to pay for gas God knows that shifting gears ai nt what it used to be I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen three on a tree Hey whatever happened to waitin your turn Doing it all by hand cause when everything is handed to you It s only worth as much as the time put in It all just seems so good the way we had it Back before everything became automatic If you had something to say You d write it on a piece of paper Then you put a stamp on it And they d get it three days later Boys would call the girls And girls would turn them down Staying married was the only way to work your problems out Hey whatever happened to waitin your turn Doing it all by hand cause when everything is handed to you It s only worth as much as the time put in In all just seems so good the way we had it Back before everything became automatic Automatic Let s roll the windows down Windows with the cranks Come on let s take a picture The kind you got ta shake Hey whatever happened to waitin your turn Doing it all by hand cause when everything is handed to you It s only worth as much as the time put in In all just seems so good the way we had it Back before everything became automatic
