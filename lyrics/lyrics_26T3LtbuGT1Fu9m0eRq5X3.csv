Cage The Elephant,26T3LtbuGT1Fu9m0eRq5X3,Ain't No Rest for the Wicked,3Pzh926pXggbMe2ZpXyMV7, You wan na you know it you wan na I was walking down the street When out the corner of my eye I saw a pretty little thing approachin me She said I never seen a man Who looked so all alone Could you use a little company If you pay the right price Your evening will be nice And you can go and send me on my way I said You re such a sweet young thing Why you do this to yourself She looked at me and this is what she said Oh there ai nt no rest for the wicked Money do nt grow on trees I got bills to pay I got mouths to feed There ai nt nothing in this world for free I know I ca nt slow down I ca nt hold back Though you know I wish I could Oh no there ai nt no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good Not even fifteen minutes later I m still walking down the street When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight And then he swept up from behind He put a gun up to my head He made it clear he was nt looking for a fight He said Give me all you ve got I want your money not your life But if you try to make a move I wo nt think twice I told him You can have my cash But first you know I got to ask What made you want to live this kind of life He said There ai nt no rest for the wicked Money do nt grow on trees I got bills to pay I got mouths to feed There ai nt nothing in this world for free I know I ca nt slow down I ca nt hold back Though you know I wish I could Oh no there ai nt no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good Yeah You know it you wan na you know it you wan na Well now a couple hours passed And I was sitting at my house The day was winding down and coming to an end An so I turned on the TV And flipped it over to the news And what I saw I almost could nt comprehend I saw a preacher man in cuffs He d taken money from the church He d stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills But even still I ca nt say much Because I know we re all the same Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills You know there ai nt no rest for the wicked Money do nt grow on trees We got bills to pay we got mouths to feed There ai nt nothing in this world for free I know we ca nt slow down we ca nt hold back Though you know we wish we could Oh no there ai nt no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good

Cage The Elephant,26T3LtbuGT1Fu9m0eRq5X3,Cigarette Daydreams,2tznHmp70DxMyr2XhWLOW0, Did you stand there all alone Oh I can not explain what s going down I can see you standing next to me In and out somewhere else right now You sigh look away I can see it clear as day Close your eyes so afraid Hide behind that baby face Do do do do do do You can drive all night Looking for answers in the pouring rain You wan na find peace of mind Looking for the answer Funny how it seems like yesterday As I recall you were looking out of place Gathered up your things and slipped away No time at all I followed you into the hall Cigarette daydream You were only seventeen Soft speak with a mean streak Nearly brought me to my knees Do do do do do do You can drive all night Looking for the answers in the pouring rain You wan na find peace of mind Looking for the answer If we could find a reason a reason to change Looking for the answer If you could find a reason a reason to stay Standing in the pouring rain Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do You can drive all night Looking for answers in the pouring rain You wan na find peace of mind Looking for the answer If we could find a reason a reason to change Looking for the answer If you could find a reason a reason to stay Standing in the pouring rain

Cage The Elephant,26T3LtbuGT1Fu9m0eRq5X3,Shake Me Down,1Hb1IJ9bBCa6wo3fRtexnJ, Shake me down Not a lot of people left around Who knows now Softly laying on the ground ooh Not a lot of people left around ooh ooh In my life I have seen people walk into the sea Just to find memories plagued by constant misery Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground Their eyes cast down I ll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Shake me down Cut my hair on a silver cloud Broken sound Softly laying on the ground ooh Not a lot of people left around ooh ooh In my past bittersweet There s no love between the sheets Taste the blood broken dreams Lonely times indeed With eyes cast down fixed upon the ground With eyes cast down I ll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Turn back now it s time for me to let go Way down had to find a place to lay low Lampshade turned around into a light post Walk around the corner never saw it coming Still I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief I do nt wan na know the future I m like rolling thunder Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day I ll keep my eyes fixed on the I ll keep my eyes fixed on the I ll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Shake me down Not a lot of people left around ooh ooh
