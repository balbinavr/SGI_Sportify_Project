Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,Never in My Wildest Dreams,3MJov5mT64K42o1Rffhblq, Never in my wildest dreams Would I be loving you Never in my wildest dreams Would my dreams come true You re just too good to touch I ca nt discuss it much I get too choked up Do nt wan na make a scene Never in my wildest dreams Never in my wildest dreams Would I roam this land Sail across the seven seas I m a hard luck man I know where my purpose is It ai nt on some pilgrimage It s wherever my baby is My love supreme Never in my wildest dreams Walk in the cold cold wind Carry my laundry bin Take my rags for a spin Watch daytime TV You re just too good to touch And I ca nt discuss it much I get too choked up Do nt wan na make a scene Never in my wildest dreams

Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,Malibu Man,5fp7TUlIjOMdhNMkJJIvgx, I moved from New York with my boogie board And bought a big house on the ocean Stopped eating meat I took the shoes off my feet Just because I took the notion My hair gave in so my beard came out Caused quite a facial commotion It grew past my lips and then it covered my mouth So no one could read my emotions Malibu Man Is nt life grand He s got the world in his hands Malibu Man Sometimes I get up but I m feeling down I do nt have a sister or brother No family no wife but I m still living the life Just step from one stone to the other I m a myth of man I ride the waves when I can I make the music so people will buy it I take pride in my ways and my colossal paydays I m just an oldfashion retailers riot Malibu Man Is nt life grand He s got the world in his hands Malibu Man Malibu Man Is nt life grand He s got the world in his hands Malibu Man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up Malibu man Give it up give it up
Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,King of a One Horse Town,4QF8w44G6fU4VNxQJK1OJn, Everyday is just a little white lie Telling myself I m gettin by I just stay in this room and cry The snow it covers up the ground And I ca nt hear a single sound Turn off the TV and go for a drive But I ca nt see there s any signs of life Kept a Christmas tree with blinking lights I coulda made it but I messed around I m a loser with a rusty crown Scared if I jump in the ocean I might drown King of a one horse town I m the king of a one horse town And I barely pull my weight around I thought about leaving but I do nt know Would nt even know anywhere to go Guess I ll stay on desolation row Go get stoned and hang around The beat of my drum is the only sound I d jump into the ocean but I m scared I d drown King of a one horse town King of a one horse town King of a one horse town And I barely pull my weight around I m a king of a one horse town King of a one horse town King of a one horse town And I barely pull my weight around King of a one horse town King of a one horse town King of a one horse town And I barely pull my weight around
Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,Undertow,2Zv95uoSB1H4puVfAYbovF, The games we play The tales we spin It s always the way Original sin Would you dive for me in the icy sea Pry me free from this life I lead Undertow Sad old memories from so long ago Here they come to drag me down below Here it comes the undertow Solider of fortune Or broke down dog Sign of the scorpion Or a hollow log Would you dive for me in the icy sea Pry me free from this life I lead Undertow Sad old memories from so long ago Here they come to drag me down below Here it comes the undertow Undertow Sad old memories from so long Here they come to drag me down below Here it comes the undertow

Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,"Heartbroken, In Disrepair",2Bcu8cmU7qYu3qXLowHQie, There is no light there is no charm charm All my belongings I hold with one arm one Under the bridge sleep in the shade shade All of the terrible choices that I made Searchin for light Gasping for air air Heartbroken in disrepair oh God may forgive me but that s not enough nough Cause I got ta live with myself till I m dust dust Just walk on by if we pass on the street street Sometimes in battle it s best to retreat Searchin for light Gasping for air air Heartbroken in disrepair oh
Dan Auerbach,6YWdHD3R863Apw1hkx3BwC,Waiting on a Song,1NoWKTDd0FnhUiIevfCU7u, I been thinking I ve been hummin I been pickin and I been strumming Just waiting waiting on a song I been hitchin I been thumbin I can almost hear one coming I m just waiting waiting on a song I looked down in my pocket Underneath the bed Walked under a lamppost And one hit me on the head Am I blind or too dumb to see All the sound surrounding me I m just waiting waiting on a song You can look up at the stars Bow your head and count the cars You ll still be waiting waiting on a song Might be a bluebird or a crow On a cord between two poles They re just waiting waiting on a song Songs do nt grow on trees You got ta pick em out the breeze Fall down on your knees And pray one comes along When those railroad gates come down You got ta stop and turn around Or you ll be waiting waiting on a song You ll be waiting waiting on a song
