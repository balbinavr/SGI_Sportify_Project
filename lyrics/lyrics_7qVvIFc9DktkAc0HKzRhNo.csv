Johnny Hartman,7qVvIFc9DktkAc0HKzRhNo,My One And Only Love,1BPmVDqR4cX9aFC0Qx0eWn, The very thought of you makes my heart sing Like an April breeze on the wings of spring And you appear in all your splendor My one and only love The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms In the hush of night while you re in my arms I feel your lips so warm and tender My one and only love The touch of your hand is like heaven A heaven that I ve never known The blush on your cheek whenever I speak Tells me that you are my own You fill my eager heart with such desire Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire I give myself in sweet surrender My one and only love My one and only love
Johnny Hartman,7qVvIFc9DktkAc0HKzRhNo,They Say It's Wonderful,3VhAS0ferVrcN4ANKnGCmM, They say that falling in love is wonderful So wonderful so they say The thing that s known as romance is wonderful So wonderful so they tell me I ca nt recall who said it I know I never read it I only know they tell me that love is grand And if there s a moon up above It s wonderful wonderful In every way So they say You ll leave your house one morning And without any warning You find yourself shouting that love is grand To hold your girl in your arms Is wonderful wonderful In every way So they say
Johnny Hartman,7qVvIFc9DktkAc0HKzRhNo,I See Your Face Before Me,2vCkgrqIdqbcf8Wyyp4V01, I see your face before me Crowding my every dream There is your face before me You are my only theme It does nt matter where you are I can see how fair you are I close my eyes and there you are Always If you could share the magic If you could see me too There would be nothing tragic In all my dreams of you Would that my love could haunt you so Knowing I want you so I ca nt erase Your beautiful face before me Short Musical Break Would that my love could haunt you so Knowing I want you so I ca nt erase Your beautiful face before me
Johnny Hartman,7qVvIFc9DktkAc0HKzRhNo,Lush Life,4xPO2pWQUBPCcGXCCKswRS, I used to visit all the very gay places Those comewhatmay places Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life To get the feel of life From jazz and cocktails The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces With distingu traces That used to be there You could see where they d been washed away By too many through the day Twelve o clock tales Then you came along with your siren song To tempt me to madness I thought for awhile that your poignant smile Was tinged with the sadness Of a great love for me Ah yes I was wrong Again I was wrong Life is lonely again and only last year Everything seemed so sure Now life is awful Again a troughful of hearts Could only be a bore A week in Paris would ease the bite of it All I care is to smile in spite of it I ll forget you I will While yet you are still Burning inside my brain Romance is mush Stifling those who strive I ll live a lush life in some small dive And there I ll be While I rot with the rest Of those whose lives are lonely too Romance is mush Stifling those who strive I ll live a lush life in some small dive And there I ll be While I rot with the rest Of those whose lives are lonely too
