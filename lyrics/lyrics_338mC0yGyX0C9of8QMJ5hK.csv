Gene Ammons,338mC0yGyX0C9of8QMJ5hK,Canadian Sunset,0zLisqJwBErrC3ja1cQc60, Once I was alone So lonely and then You came out of nowhere Like the sun up from the hills Cold cold was the wind Warm warm were your lips Out there on that ski trail Where your kiss filled me with thrills A weekend in Canada a change of scene Was the most I bargained for And then I discovered you and in your eyes I found the love that I could nt ignore Down down came the sun Fast fast fast beat my heart I knew when the sun set From that day we d never ever part
