Craig Morgan,6ktyNEnEukKzskQEiXgCFD,That's What I Love About Sunday,1fmi1hOBtH8xfUiWz4LVtE, Raymond s in his Sunday best He s usually up to his chest in oil an grease There s the Martin s walkin in With that mean little frecklefaced kid Who broke a window last week Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me That s what I love about Sunday Sing along as the choir sways Every verse of Amazin Grace An then we shake the Preacher s hand Go home into your blue jeans Have some chicken an some baked beans Pick a back yard football team Not do much of anything That s what I love about Sunday I stroll to the end of the drive Pick up the Sunday Times grab my coffee cup It looks like Sally an Ron finally tied the knot Well it s about time It s 35 cents off a ground round Baby cut that coupon out That s what I love about Sunday Catnapping on the porch swing You curled up next to me The smell of jasmine wakes us up Take a walk down a back road Tackle box and a cane pole Carve our names in that white oak An steal a kiss as the sun fades That s what I love about Sunday Oh yeah Ooh new believers gettin baptized Momma s hands raised up high Havin a Hallelujah good time A smile on everybody s face That s what I love about Sunday Oh yeah That s what I love about Sunday Oh yeah

Craig Morgan,6ktyNEnEukKzskQEiXgCFD,Almost Home,6FW9MTGMjR5A6q2o7PLuuz, He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes He was covered with the evening news Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands The bank sign was flashing five below It was freezing rain an spittin snow He was curled up behind some garbage cans I was afraid that he was dead I gave him a gentle shake When he opened up his eyes I said Old man are you okay He said I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin from some honey bees Drip dryin in the summer breeze After jumpin into Calico creek I was walkin down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you d just left me alone Cause I was almost home Then he said I s just comin round the barn Bout the time you grabbed my arm When I heard Momma holler Son hurry up I was close enough for my own nose To smell fresh cobbler on the stove And I saw daddy loadin up the truck Cane poles on the tailgate Bobbers blowin in the wind Since July of 55 That s as close as I ve been Yeah I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin from some honey bees Drip dryin in the summer breeze After jumpin into Calico creek I was walkin down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you d just left me alone I was almost home I said Old man you re gon na freeze to death Let me drive you to the mission He said Boy if you d left me alone Right now I d be fishin I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin from some honey bees Drip dryin in the summer breeze After jumpin into Calico creek I was walkin down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you d just left me alone Cause I was almost home Almost home Man I wish you d just left me alone I was almost home

Craig Morgan,6ktyNEnEukKzskQEiXgCFD,It Took A Woman,6rFUAxTX8TgZHWdzfA1ivt, It took a bully riding my back To make me mad enough to fight And a summer with my granddad To find out what hard work s like It took that football coach in high school To make me tougher than the rest And that first beer with my daddy To put that first hair on my chest It took a heart to heart with Jesus To bring me to my knees But it took a woman to make a man out of me It took a pair of soft blue eyes And a smile so sweet To make me reach up high And really dig down deep She s made me so much more than who I used to be It took a woman to make a man out of me It took the first year we were dating And drinking too much with the boys For her to give an ultimatum For me to have to make a choice It took a want add in the paper To sell that 68 Firebird And buy that diamond ring I gave her And rent out that little church It took the day my baby girl was born To make a tear roll down my cheek It took a woman to make a man out of me It took a pair of soft blue eyes And a smile so sweet To make me reach up high And really dig down deep She s made me so much more than who I used to be It took a woman to make a man out of me

Craig Morgan,6ktyNEnEukKzskQEiXgCFD,What Matters Most,0SU27YJzHF31hVWEqCSIpG, No it ai nt about the place he s been living for the past 8 months And it ai nt about the badges on his uniform And it ai nt about the oil like they say it is in the news You ll never hear him say It do nt matter anymore Cause what matters most is still at home Gathered round the table barely barely able to get through the day Without thinking bout him and their life without him So he makes sure that they know that he knows what matters most She gets mad when someone talks bad about the red white and blue She says they do nt understand what it stands for Said if they spend just one day on their knees in her shoes They d be a little appreciative of that I m sure Cause what matters most is down the road At the veterans cemetery where his best friends carried him and laid him down They think about him and their life without him They make sure that everybody knows what matters most What matters most is still at home That little boy and girl living in a world that s forever changed They think about him and their life without him They make sure that everybody knows Not a day goes by that they do nt let it show what matters most What matters most She gets mad when someone talks bad about the red white and blue She says they do nt understand what it stands for
