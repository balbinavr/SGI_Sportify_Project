Jonny Lang,5rX1EodZfwxmW4fQX2Caot,Before You Hit The Ground,6X3oobD0XUStLRoCciGEmj, I seen every one of the faces you wear Low high and everything in between Your eyes are fixed on the prize like a dead man s stare Tick tock The hands on the clock do nt care Buzz is good Feelin fine One of these days You ll be out of time God ai nt gon na look for you Down in the lost and found You better look up or you re gon na be gone Before you hit the ground You ll keep dippin in till the well run dry Hope you do nt get thirsty later I know talking to you s just a waste of my time I m gon na stop tellin you how to live your life Solo One more Time to score so make it fast When you lose your mind you got no mind left to lose Three four open the door to your last chance And when you get where you re goin you wo nt be comin back You better look up or you re gon na be gone Before you hit the ground

Jonny Lang,5rX1EodZfwxmW4fQX2Caot,Make It Move,2aXKckAZJNuNO2XQTCy4V3, Late in the evening It all come pouring in It s quite night but in my mind the sound is defining And it s all the regrets And it s all the shame And it s all in my head But its stronger than any chain The greatest lie I told myself was that it could not be done Watching others take the prize when I should have been the one You could waste your whole life waiting for that mountain to move But its waiting on you It s waiting on you It s waiting on you You got to make it move yeahh I see you on your front porch Judging all the rest When just behind you front door Your own house lays in a mess And it s the fear And it s all the pain And it s all the years Washed down the drain Long ago you dreamed above once on the other side But you lived so long in the foot hills you ve forgotten how to climb You spent your whole life waiting for the mountain to move But its waiting on you It s waiting on you It s waiting on you You got to make it move YOU GOT TO MAKE A MOVE yeahh You could spend your whole life waiting for the mountain to move But its waiting on you It s waiting on you It s waiting on you You got to make it move You got to make it move

Jonny Lang,5rX1EodZfwxmW4fQX2Caot,Still Rainin',54gA6uJNz3wDhq4kEwE9i8, Clouds one by one fill the sky Just like these tears that fill my eyes I know by now she ai nt comin back I watch my world slowly fade into black Look out my window it s still rainin Look out my window it s still rainin They say that time heals everything I ve felt the pain that love can bring It do nt get no better with each passing day Any hope I had is slowly slipping away Look out my window it s still rainin Look out my window it s still rainin I thought the morning would rescue me But the rain keeps falling endlessly endlessly Sometimes I wonder what ll become of me There ai nt much left of what I used to be Her love shone on me like the morning light Now here I am alone again tonight Look out my window it s still rainin Look out my window it s still rainin

Jonny Lang,5rX1EodZfwxmW4fQX2Caot,Darker Side,6UKK1aknxvEUPzqUT3laCE, Look at the man with the smile on his face Looks like he s always feelin good Sometimes you might want to take his place And sometimes I think that you would When the sun is goin down And there is no place to hide Even in the brightest light You might lean toward the darker side Look at the people they learn how to lie so easy They learn how to lie to get what they need And after they got what they needed It turns into a simple case of greed When they no longer feel ashamed And they ve lost all sense of pride Misery loves company And it s lonely on the darker side And when the party is over And the music has died You ll be dancin to the music baby Somewhere on the darker side Somewhere on the darker side
