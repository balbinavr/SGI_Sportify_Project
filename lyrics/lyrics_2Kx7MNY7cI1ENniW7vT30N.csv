Norah Jones,2Kx7MNY7cI1ENniW7vT30N,Don't Know Why,6ybViy2qrO9sIi41EgRJgx, I waited till I saw the sun I do nt know why I did nt come I left you by the house of fun I do nt know why I did nt come I Do nt know why I did nt come When I saw the break of day I wished that I could fly away Instead of kneeling in the sand Catching teardrops in my hand My heart is drenched in wine But you ll be on my mind forever Out across the endless sea I would die in ecstasy But I ll be a bag of bones Driving down the road alone My heart is drenched in wine But you ll be on my mind forever Something has to make you run I do nt know why I did nt come I feel as empty as a drum I do nt know why I did nt come I Do nt know why I did nt come I do nt know why I did nt come

Norah Jones,2Kx7MNY7cI1ENniW7vT30N,Seven Years,39kuVkJjfRjXqUpAtkDItK, Spinning laughing dancing To her favorite song A little girl with nothing wrong Is all alone Eyes wide open Always hoping for the sun And she ll sing her song to anyone That comes along Fragile as a leaf in autumn Just fallin to the ground Without a sound Crooked little smile On her face Tells a tale of grace That s all her own Fragile as a leaf in autumn Just fallin to the ground Without a sound Spinning laughing dancing To her favorite song She s a little girl with nothing wrong And she s all alone A little girl with nothing wrong And she s all alone
