Jerry Garcia,3QDaXfnxfQqqJQK5lSdjLN,Let It Rock,6ja9WsXHcz9s6Egpy8b9az, Well up in the evening down in Mobile Alabama Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer Got ta make some money to buy some brand new shoes Trying to find somebody to take away these blues She do nt love me hear them singing in the sun Payday s coming and my work is all done Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow Sitting in a tepee built right on the tracks Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about We ve got an offschedule train comin two miles about Everybody s trembling and running around Picking up their money tearing the tepee down Foreman wants a penny about to go insane Trying to get the workers out the way of the train Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long Ca nt stop the train got ta let it roll on
