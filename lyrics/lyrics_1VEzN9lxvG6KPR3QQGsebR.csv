Sonny Rollins,1VEzN9lxvG6KPR3QQGsebR,St. Thomas,5bUNvFQYiAqJWZ4cQ9MlSZ, Embrace me my sweet embraceable you Embrace me you irreplaceable you Just one look at you My heart grew tipsy in me You and you alone Bring out the gypsy in me I love all the many charms about you Above all I want my arms about you Do nt be a naughty baby Come to papa come to papa do My sweet embraceable you
Sonny Rollins,1VEzN9lxvG6KPR3QQGsebR,Without a Song - Remastered,6NeCoPvzhTHcBu3RFzbY3X, Without a song the day would never end Without a song the road would never bend When things go wrong a man ai nt got a friend Without a song That field of corn would never see a plow That field of corn would be deserted now A man is born but he s no good no how Without a song I got my trouble and woe but sure as I know the Jordan will roll And I ll get along as long as a song strong in my soul I ll never know what makes the rain to fall I ll never know what makes that grass so tall I only know there ai nt no love at all Without a song Ivea got my trouble and woe and sure as I know the Jordan will roll And I ll get along as long as a song strong in my soul Illa never know what makes that rain to fall I ll never know what makes the grass so tall I only know there ai nt no love at all Without a song
