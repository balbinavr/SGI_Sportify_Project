Thin Lizzy,6biWAmrHyiMkX49LkycGqQ,Emerald,6oe6yYpgZWPYUwxKzG3HIL, Down from the glen came the marching men With their shields and their swords To fight the fight they believed to be right And overthrow the overlords To the towns where there was plenty They brought plunder swords and flame When they left the town was empty And children would never play again From their graves I heard the fallen Above the battle cry By that bridge near the border There were many more to die Then onward over the mountain And outward towards the sea They had come to claim the Emerald Without it they could not leave
