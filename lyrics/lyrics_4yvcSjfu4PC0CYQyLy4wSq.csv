Glass Animals,4yvcSjfu4PC0CYQyLy4wSq,The Other Side Of Paradise,0rRjGruFonCGOt0S5zAJNQ, When I was young and stupid my love Left to be a rock and roll star He told me please do nt worry Wise little smile that spoke so safely He booked a one way ticket Out west that s where they make it Six kids stuck in a bedsit To sunswept poolside riches He met a girl who wore Versace Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry Gon na be a hoop phenomenon He s gon na be Hakeem Olajuwon He s got a gold Camaro He said over the payphone I try to keep my cool but My life turns in slow motion Bye bye baby blue I wish you could see the wicked truth Caught up in a rush it s killing you Screaming at the sun you blow into Curled up in a grip when we were us Fingers in a fist like you might run I settle for a ghost I never knew Superparadise I held on to But I settle for a ghost When I was from nola no one Left to be a rock and roll star He d stay and treat his lady Give everything to his new baby I miss him do nt you blame me That boy went stone cold crazy Caught up in camera lust hes Chasing that pappy pipe dreams I know you do nt but I I know you do nt but I still try My thunder shook him down My thunder came and shook him down That girl is gone but I That girl is gone but I still try I think it s over now The bullet hit but maybe not I feel so fucking numb It hits my head and I feel numb My body s looking wrong My body s looking wrong My body s looking wrong Bye bye baby blue I wish you could see the wicked truth Caught up in a rush it s killing you Screaming at the sun you blow into Curled up in a grip when we were us Fingers in a fist like you might run I settle for a ghost I never knew Superparadise I held on to But I settle for a ghost
