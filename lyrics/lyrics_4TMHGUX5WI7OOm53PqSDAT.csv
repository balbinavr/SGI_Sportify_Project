Grateful Dead,4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT,Scarlet Begonias,3euDGpS2R0NC2Xssqxohva, As I was walking round Grosvenor Square Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air From the other direction she was calling my eye It could be an illusion but I might as well try might as well try She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes And I knew without asking she was into the blues She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls I knew right away she was not like other girls other girls In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff As I picked up my matches and was closing the door I had one of those flashes I d been there before been there before Well I ai nt often right but I ve never been wrong It seldom turns out the way it does in this song Once in a while you get shown the light In the strangest of places if you look at it right Well there ai nt nothing wrong with the way she moves Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues And there s nothing wrong with the look that s in her eyes I had to learn the hard way I had to let her pass by let her pass by Wind in the willow s playing Tea for Two The sky was yellow and the sun was blue Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand Everybody s playing in the Heart of Gold Band Heart of Gold Band
Grateful Dead,4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT,Box Of Rain,7x2xjJV3YAPeLQJ7u3Kjet, Look out of any window Any morning any evening any day Maybe the sun is shining Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky What do you want me to do To do for you to see you through For this is all a dream we dreamed One afternoon long ago Walk out of any doorway Feel your way feel your way like the day before Maybe you ll find direction Around some corner where it s been waiting to meet you What do you want me to do To watch for you while you re sleeping Then please do nt be surprised When you find me dreaming too Look into any eyes you find by you You can see clear to another day Maybe been seen before Through other eyes on other days while going home What do you want me to do To do for you to see you through It s all a dream we dreamed One afternoon long ago Walk into splintered sunlight Inch your way through dead dreams to another land Maybe you re tired and broken Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear What do you want me to do To do for you to see you through A box of rain will ease the pain And love will see you through Just a box of rain wind and water Believe it if you need it if you do nt just pass it on Sun and shower wind and rain In and out the window like a moth before a flame And it s just a box of rain I do nt know who put it there Believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare And it s just a box of rain or a ribbon for your hair Such a long long time to be gone and a short time to be there

Grateful Dead,4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT,Althea,7M7AwtGvWdMYudqx5Iuh1m, I told Althea I was feeling lost Lacking in some direction Althea told me upon scrutiny That my back might need protection I told Althea that treachery Was tearing me limb from limb Althea told me Now cool down boy Settle back easy Jim You may be Saturday s child all grown Moving with a pinch of grace You may be a clown in the burial ground Or just another pretty face You may be the fate of Ophelia Sleeping and perchance to dream Honest to the point of recklessness Selfcentered to the extreme Ai nt nobody messing with you but you Your friends are getting most concerned Loose with the truth maybe it s your fire Baby do nt get burned When the smoke has cleared she said That s what she said to me You re gon na want a bed to lay your head And a little sympathy There are things you can replace And others you can not The time has come to weigh those things This space is getting hot You know this space is getting hot I told Althea I m a roving sign That I was born to be a bachelor Althea told me OK that s fine So now I m trying to catch her Ca nt talk to you without talking to me We re guilty of the same old things Thinking a lot about less and less And forgetting the love we bring
Grateful Dead,4TMHGUX5WI7OOm53PqSDAT,Ripple,1OE5l6sedVcIFELMuxQOPI, If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung Would you hear my voice come through the music Would you hold it near as if it were your own It s a handmedown the thoughts are broken Perhaps they re better left unsung I do nt know do nt really care Let there be songs to fill the air Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow Reach out your hand if your cup be empty If your cup is full may it be again Let it be known there is a fountain That was not made by the hands of men There is a road no simple highway Between the dawn and the dark of night And if you go no one may follow That path is for your steps alone Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow You who choose to lead must follow But if you fall you fall alone If you should stand then who s to guide you If I knew the way I would take you home La de da da La da da da da da La de da Da da La da da da da La de da da da La da da da da da La da da da La da da da da
