The White Stripes,4F84IBURUo98rz4r61KF70,Seven Nation Army,7i6r9KotUPQg3ozKKgEPIN, I m gon na fight em off A seven nation army could nt hold me back They re gon na rip it off Taking their time right behind my back And I m talking to myself at night Because I ca nt forget Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette And a message coming from my eyes Says leave it alone Do nt want to hear about it Every single one s got a story to tell Everyone knows about it From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell And if I catch it coming back my way I m gon na serve it to you And that ai nt what you want to hear But that s what I ll do And the feeling coming from my bones Says find a home I m going to Wichita Far from this opera forevermore I m gon na work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore And I m bleeding and I m bleeding and I m bleeding Right before the lord All the words are gon na bleed from me And I will think no more And the stains coming from my blood Tell me go back home
