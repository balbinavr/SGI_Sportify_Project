Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Like a Rolling Stone,3AhXZa8sUQht0UEdBJgpGc, Once upon a time you dressed so fine You threw the bums a dime in your prime Did nt you People d call say Beware doll you re bound to fall You thought they were all Kiddin you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hanging out Now you do nt talk so loud Now you do nt seem so proud About having to be scrounging For your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone Oh you ve gone to the finest school alright miss lonely But you know you only used to get Juiced in it Nobody s ever taught you how to live out on the street And now you re gon na have to get Used to it You say you d never compromise With the mystery tramp but now you realize He s not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say Do you want to Make a deal How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone Oh you never turned around to see the frowns On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did Tricks for you You never understood that it ai nt no good You should nt let other people get your Kicks for you You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat Ai nt it hard when you discover that He really was nt where it s at After he took from you everything He could steal How does it feel How does it feel To hang on your home With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They re all drinking thinking that they Got it made Exchanging all their precious gifts But you d better take your diamond ring You d better pawn it baby You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now he calls you you ca nt refuse When you ai nt got nothing you got nothing to lose You re invisible now you got no secrets To conceal How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone
Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,The Times They Are A-Changin',52vA3CYKZqZVdQnzRrdZt6, Come gather round people wherever you roam And admit that the waters around you have grown And accept it that soon you ll be drenched to the bone If your time to you is worth savin Then you better start swimmin or you ll sink like a stone For the times they are achangin Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen And keep your eyes wide the chance wo nt come again And do nt speak too soon for the wheel s still in spin And there s no tellin who that it s namin For the loser now will be later to win For the times they are achangin Come senators congressmen please heed the call Do nt stand in the doorway do nt block up the hall For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled The battle outside ragin Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls For the times they are achangin Come mothers and fathers throughout the land And do nt criticize what you ca nt understand Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command Your old road is rapidly agin Please get out of the new one if you ca nt lend your hand For the times they are achangin The line it is drawn the curse it is cast The slow one now will later be fast As the present now will later be past The order is rapidly fadin And the first one now will later be last For the times they are achangin
Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Hurricane,1lqMLr9Wj7SM2F9AikGcxN, Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out My God they ve killed them all Here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For somethin that he never done Put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been The champion of the world Three bodies lyin there does Patty see And another man named Bello movin around mysteriously I did nt do it he says and he throws up his hands I was only robbin the register I hope you understand I saw them leavin he says and he stops One of us had better call up the cops And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin In the hot New Jersey night Meanwhile far away in another part of town Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin around Number one contender for the middleweight crown Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road Just like the time before and the time before that In Paterson that s just the way things go If you re black you might as well not show up on the street Less you wan na draw the heat Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin around He said I saw two men runnin out they looked like little apes They jumped into a white car withoutofstate plates And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said Wait a minute boys this one s not dead So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see He told em he could identify the guilty men Four in the mornin and they haul Rubin in They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs The wounded man looks up through his one dyin eye Says Why d you bring him in here for He ai nt the guy Yes here s the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For somethin that he never done Put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been The champion of the world Four months later the ghettos are in flame Rubin s in South America fightin for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley s still in the robbery game And the cops are puttin the screws to him lookin for somebody to blame Remember that murder that happened in a bar Remember you said you saw the getaway car You think you d like to play ball with the law Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw runnin that night Do nt forget that you are white Arthur Dexter Bradley said I m really not sure The cop said A poor boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job and we re talkin to your friend Bello You do nt wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow You ll be doin society a favor That sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder on him He ai nt no Gentleman Jim Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much It s my work he d say I do it for pay And when it s over I d just as soon go on my way Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along the trail But then they took him to the jailhouse Where they try to turn a man into a mouse All of Rubin s cards were marked in advance The trial was a pigcircus he never had a chance The judge made Rubin s witnesses drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger No one doubted that he pulled the trigger And though they could not produce the gun The DA said he was the one who did the deed And the allwhite jury agreed Rubin Carter was falsely tried The crime was murder one guess who testified Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers they all went along for the ride How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool s hand To see him obviously framed Could nt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink martinis and watch the sunrise While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell An innocent man in a living hell Yes that s the story of the Hurricane But it wo nt be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he s done Put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been The champion of the world

Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Girl from the North Country (with Johnny Cash),4K1imZQQ0yKtJ40vGmUajS, If you re traveling in the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to the one who lives there For she once was a true love of mine If you go when the snowflakes storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends Please see if she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howling winds Please see if her hair hangs long If it rolls and flows all down her breast Please see from me if her hair is hanging long For that s the way I remember her best I m wondering if she remembers me at all So many times I ve thought and prayed In the darkness of my night And the brightness of my days So if you re traveling in the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to the one who lives there For she once was a true love of mine
Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Shelter from the Storm,3y4Uza6K58JXQ7RYya8ZI5, T was in another lifetime one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm And if I pass this way again you can rest assured I ll always do my best for her on that I give my word In a world of steeleyed death and men who are fighting to be warm Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved Everything up to that point had been left unresolved Try imagining a place where it s always safe and warm Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm I was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes an blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm Suddenly I turned around and she was standin there With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm Now there s a wall between us somethin there s been lost I took too much for granted I got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began on an noneventful morn Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much it s doom alone that counts And the oneeyed undertaker he blows a futile horn Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm I ve heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation an she gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm Well I m livin in a foreign country but I m bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor s edge someday I ll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born Come in she said I ll give you shelter from the storm

Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Mr. Tambourine Man,3RkQ3UwOyPqpIiIvGVewuU, Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me I m not sleepy and there is no place I m going to Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jinglejangle morning I ll come followin you Though I know that evening s empire Has returned into sand Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping My weariness amazes me I am branded on my feet I have no one to meet And the ancient empty street s too dead for dreaming Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me I m not sleepy and there is no place I m going to Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jinglejangle morning I ll come followin you Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship My senses have been stripped my hands ca nt feel to grip My toes too numb to step Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering I m ready to go anywhere I m ready for to fade Into my own parade Cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me I m not sleepy and there is no place I m going to Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jinglejangle morning I ll come followin you Though you might hear laughing spinning swinging madly across the sun It s not aimed at anyone It s just escaping on the run And but for the sky there are no fences facing And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme To your tambourine in time It s just a ragged clown behind I would nt pay it any mind It s just a shadow you re seeing that he s chasing Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me I m not sleepy and there is no place I m going to Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jinglejangle morning I ll come followin you Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me I m not sleepy and there is no place I m going to Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jinglejangle morning I ll come followin you
Bob Dylan,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Tangled up in Blue,6Vcwr9tb3ZLO63F8DL8cqu, Early one morning the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she d changed it all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was gon na be rough They never did like mama s homemade dress Papa s bankbook was nt big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the east coast Lord knows I ve paid some dues getting through Tangled up in blue She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out west Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder We ll meet again someday on the avenue Tangled up in blue I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the axe just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I s lucky for to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind and I just grew Tangled up in blue She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the sight of her face In the spotlight so clear And later on when the crowd thinned out I s just about to do the same She was standing there in back of my chair Said Tell me do nt I know your name I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe I thought you d never say hello she said You look like the silent type Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafs at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue So now I m going back again I got to get her somehow All the people we used to know They re an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter s wives Do nt know how it all got started I do nt what they do with their lives But me I m still on the road Heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue
