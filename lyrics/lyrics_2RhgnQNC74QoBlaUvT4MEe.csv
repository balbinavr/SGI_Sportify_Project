The Growlers,2RhgnQNC74QoBlaUvT4MEe,Dope on a Rope,0SoPLeJAxzUh6rKBSzVeog, Dope in the wash strangers in bed Nights they make a heart beat half dead In the mirror striking a pose Conjured up glamour in a school play rock show Guess it does nt last forever just a feeling to remember Dope on a rope we hang the cat walks the plank Unless we turn around and do it again Generations change In a blink the fad s extinct Find your lover or you ll flash the fame Before you wake up from your dream Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times Collect taxidermy fist As much is on your wrist New friends flood the list till you re sick Trying to have a ball in a tanked up stall Numb when its from making sense of it all I guess it does nt last forever Just the feeling to remember Dope on a rope we hang the cat walks the plank Unless we turn around and do it again Generations change In a blink the fad s extinct Find your lover or you ll taste the fame Before you wake up from your dream Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
The Growlers,2RhgnQNC74QoBlaUvT4MEe,Night Ride,2ZQ3CJY6iddn38oOoPGKfb, Too soon wanted more time Could ve held out but your clock was ticking No easing in straightened out lines Alone with your thoughts Cause your friends are still in Night clubs and back rooms Baggies in the bathrooms Nothing s changed but you Saying nothing s missing Thoughts are drifting away from you Morning sun fills the void Now you see there never was a point Over and over and over again Till you can no longer pretend you are sane Try but you could nt get any more sure And the ending still will never change Tomorrow night ll go on without you Go on without you there Tomorrow night ll go on without you Till dawn and no one will care You ca nt know it s a move in the dark Hesitation leaves you hung on the lip Unclench your teeth Peel off the smile See no one there and you release your grip Night clubs and back rooms Baggies in the bathrooms Nothing s changed but you Saying nothing s missing Thoughts are drifting away from you Led the beast to the cliff One more step and a long way down The morning sun fills the void Now you see there never was a point Over and over and over again Till you can no longer pretend you are sane Try but you could nt get any more sure And the ending still will never change
