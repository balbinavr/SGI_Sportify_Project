Deep Purple,568ZhdwyaiCyOGJRtNYhWf,Smoke On the Water,5SAUIWdZ04OxYfJFDchC7S, We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We did nt have much time AFrank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound AFunky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids out the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty cold and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside heh Making our music there With a few red lights heh a few old beds heh We made a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this heh I know I know we ll never forget Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water

Deep Purple,568ZhdwyaiCyOGJRtNYhWf,Perfect Strangers,4dlupPB3jYjgTuow5ayOkM, Can you remember Remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown And cold cold spirits of ice All my life I am the echo of your past I am returning The echo of a point in time Distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known And laughing as the spirits appear All your life shadows of another day If you hear me talking on the wind You ve got to understand We must remain Perfect strangers I know I must remain Inside this silent well of sorrow A strand of silver Hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind Is aching with the dead of the night Precious life your tears are lost in falling rain And if you hear me talking on the wind You ve got to understand We must remain Perfect strangers

Deep Purple,568ZhdwyaiCyOGJRtNYhWf,Soldier Of Fortune,5NDyPVjcjK0hw2sUjjWFIO, I have often told you stories about the way I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day When I d take your hand and sing you songs And may be you would say Come lay with me and love me And I would surely stay But I feel I m growing older And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going round Guess I ll always be A soldier of fortune Many times I ve been a traveller I looked for something new In days of old when nights were cold I wandered without you Those days I thought my eyes Had seen you standing near Though blindness is confusing It shows that you re not here Now I feel I m growing older And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going round Guess I ll always be A soldier of fortune Yes I can hear the sound Of a windmill going round I guess I ll always be A soldier of fortune I guess I ll always be A soldier of fortune
Deep Purple,568ZhdwyaiCyOGJRtNYhWf,Knocking At Your Back Door,0G9lmpE2wszJo2WNLFZ4vA, Sweet Lucy was a dancer But none of us would chance her Because she was a Samurai She made electric shadows Beyond our fingertips And none of us could reach that high She came on like a teaser I had to touch and please her Enjoy a little paradise The log was in my pocket When Lucy met the Rockett And she never knew the reason why I ca nt deny it With that smile on her face It s not the kill It s the thrill of the chase Feel it coming It s knocking at the door You know it s no good running It s not against the law The point of no return And now you know the score And now you re learning What s knockin at your back door Sweet Nancy was so fancy To get into her pants we Had to be the aristocracy The members that she toyed with At her city club Were something in diplomacy So we put her on the hit list Of a common cunning linguist A master of many tongues And now she eases gently From her Austin to her Bentley Suddenly she feels so young I ca nt deny it With that smile on her face It s not the kill It s the thrill of the chase Feel it coming It s knocking at the door You know it s no good running No it s not against the law The point of no return And now you know the score And now you re learning What s knockin at your back door Sweet Lucy was a dancer But none of us would chance her Because she was a Samurai She made electric shadows Beyond our fingertips And none of us could reach that highhighhigh I ca nt deny it With that smile on her face Ooh It s not the kill It s the thrill of the chase Feel it coming It s knocking at your door You know it s no good running No it s knockin at your door Ah ah knockin at your back door
