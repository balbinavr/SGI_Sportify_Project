Anita O'Day,5QGnprJtpZmk3OiDqspPlB,Whisper Not,79C7NxcxlBEJcyGHGy6ZMD, Sing low sing clear Sweet words in my ear Not a whisper of despair But love s own prayer Sing on until You bring back the thrill Of a sentimental tune That died too soon Our harmony was lost But you forgave I forgot Whisper not of quarrels past You know we ve had our last So now we ll be On key constantly Love will whisper on eternally Why did we listen when they said it would nt last Gossiping voices made us break up but you know we still can make up If we forget em all and answer Cupid s call It s the truth Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past All it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not of rumours But of your love for me That s how it s got to be
