George Strait,5vngPClqofybhPERIqQMYd,Check Yes Or No,6iy4PoAuZBMvtrlDX4VxC7, It started way back in third grade I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes A pink dress a matching bow and her ponytail She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell Next day I chased her round the playground Cross the monkey bars to the merrygoround And Emmylou got caught passin me a note Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote Do you love me Do you wan na be my friend And if you do Well then do nt be afraid to take me by the hand If you want to I think this is how love goes Check yes or no Now we re grown up and she s my wife Still like two kids with stars in our eyes Ai nt much changed I still chase Emmylou Up and down the hall around the bed in our room Last night I took her out in a white limousine Twenty years together she still gets to me Ca nt believe it s been that long ago When we got started with just a little note Do you love me Do you wan na be my friend And if you do Well then do nt be afraid to take me by the hand If you want to I think this is how love goes Check yes or no Do you love me Do you wan na be my friend And if you do Well then do nt be afraid to take me by the hand If you want to I think this is how love goes Check yes or no Check yes or no Check yes or no Check yes or no Check yes or no
